The method is based upon the short-column\\nsilicic acid chromatography of saponified lipids from a hexane extract of tobacco.\\nThe free lipids are separated into non-polar, polar and terpenoid fractions and quan-\\ntitated by gas chromatography, with the use of internal standards. The applicability\\nof the method has been demonstrated by the highly reproducible analyses of a cigarette\\nblend, conventional flue-cured tobaccos and two close-grown tobaccos. The method\\nshould also be applicable to analyses of lipids in other natural products, including\\nfoodstuffs.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMany of the components in the hexane-soluble fraction of tobacco, the so-\\ncalled tobacco lipids, and their pyrolysis products contribute to the flavor and aroma\\nof tobacco smoke.

Therefore, it can\\nbe indirectly calculated by comparing the work performed with the myocardial\\noxygen usage. The former is synonymous with energy utilization, the latter\\nrepresents total energy production. Determinations of myocardial efficiency\\nfrom the oxygen consumption of the heart cannot be made unless one is sure\\nAn additional difficulty\\nthat anaerobic glycolysis in heart muscle is absent.\\nin the calculation of myocardial efficiency arises from the fact that these\\ncalculations are valid only as long as the energy produced, aside from being\\nThis represents\\ndegraded into heat, is utilized exclusively for \"useful work.\"\\nonly the mechanical work expended by the heart in overcoming resistance in\\nthe systemic and pulmonary circulation and in imparting momentum to the\\nblood stream.

Type A, is associated with the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) [1-9].\\nThe typology developed by Friedman and Rosenman [1] was based on structured\\ninterviews and observation of subject behavior. The coronary-prone behavior pattern\\ndesignated as Type A is characterized by some or all of the following: intense striving for\\nachievement, competitiveness. easily provoked impatience, time urgency, abruptness of\\ngesture and speech, overcommitment to vocation or profession, excesses of drive and\\nhostility [7].\\nMost studies of coronary-prone behavior pattern have been carried out in the USA.\\nTherefore it would be important to investigate the distribution of the behavior pattern\\nand its relationship to classical risk factors for CHD, various psychological factors and\\nprevalence of CHD in different cultures. Some such studies have been carried out in\\nBelgium [10], England [11] and in France [12, 13].\\nFor epidemiological studies, self-administrable questionnaire versions of Type A\\nmeasuring instruments have been developed [14-16].

The FTC\\nvalues do not reflect what is actually taken into the\\nbody of the cigarette smoker.\\nWhen measurements of cigarette nicotine and car\\nyields are determined by a smoking machine, a syringe\\ndraws 35-ml pulls each minute until a set length of\\ncigarette is burned. Cigarettes can have low yields in\\nsmoking-machine assays for several reasons. The to-\\nbacco may be lower in nicotine and may generate less\\ntar. The use of ventilated filters or porous cigarette\\npapers may result in dilution of the tobacco smoke.\\nPapers that burn faster may reduce the time in which\\nthe cigarette burns; faster burning means that fewer\\npuffs are taken by the machine to burn a given amount\\nof tobacco.

Only 3.8 to 5.0 per cent of total\\nvariance in blood cotinine was contributed by nicotine\\nyield.\\nWe conclude that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes do\\nnot consume less nicotine. (N Engl J Med 1983: 309:139-\\n42.)\\nuse of ventilated filters and more rapid burning times\\ncan explain much of the reduced yield of currently\\nmanufactured cigarettes. 23 The ventilation character-\\nistics of the filter as well as the number of puffs taken\\nbefore a cigarette is discarded an be controlled to a\\nsubstantial degree by the way in which the cigarette is\\nheld and smoked. Many smokers will alter their smok-\\ning behavior, changing the number of cigarettes\\nsmoked, the method of puffing, and the depth of inhal-\\ning the smoke, to maintain a desired level of nicotine\\nintake. For all these reasons, we questioned whether\\nor not smokers of low-yield cigarettes truly consume\\nless nicotine.\\nWe addressed two questions. What is in the ciga-\\nrette tobacco that is, does the tobacco of low-wield\\ncigarettes contain less nicotine? And do the FTC fig-\\nures predict the actual nicotine intake of smokers? We\\nmeasured blood concentrations of cotinine as an index\\nof nicotine consumption. Cotinine is the major metab- N\\nolite of nicotine and persists in the body for a much ☐\\nlonger period than nicotine, with a half-life averaging N\\n20 hours (unpublished data).

Experimental evidence demonstrates that exposure to substances which produce on\\ninflammatory response in the lung. such as bacterial endotoxins, causes an increase in the secretion of inflammatory\\nmediators and substances with a particular effect on tumour cells such as tumour.necrosis factor (TNF). Other irritant.\\nagents, such as tobacco smoke, may also induce an activation of macrophages at low levels of exposure.\\nEpidemiological evidence from several studies suggests that people exposed to dusts containing bactorial endor\\ntoxins have a lower lung cancer incidence than those who are unexposed. There are also some data suggesting that in\\ncente ethnic groups, famales smoking a small number of cigarettes/day, might have a lower risk for lung cancer than\\nnon-smokers. These data provide support for a hypothesis that low-dose exposures to some air pollutants might result\\nin a decreased risk of lung cancer.\\nThere is accumulating evidence that lung cancer\\ninduced by environmental agents is the final outcome\\nof a complicated balance between inducing agents and\\ndifferent defence mechanisms of the body.\\nIn view of this, it can be postulated that environ-\\nmental exposures which stimulate defence mechan-\\nisms may lead to decreased risks when compared to an\\nunexposed control population.\\nThis paper present some toxicological concepts\\nwhich are relevant for a discussion on decreased risks\\nfor lung cancer. followed by a review of some data.\\nwhich support the hypothesis that certain exposures\\nmay decrease the risk,\\nTOXICOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nA major part of the exposure to carcinogens is from\\nnatural sources, such as background radiation and\\nnatural carcinogens in food. The body must thus\\nhave a continuously working defence system against\\ntumour development.\\nRegarding the lung. a major part of the defence to\\ninhaled'agents is performed by the alveolar and inter-\\nstitial macrophages. Traditionally, the role of macro-\\nphages was considered to be the uptake of foreign\\nparticles and the transport of them up to the ciliated\\nepithelium, where the mechanical mucus escalator\\ncleared them from the lung.\\nDepamment of Environmental Hogsene.

Few studies have reported the relationship between passive smoking (PS) in early lite and the risk of\\nlung cancer. This study was done to evaluate the risk of femate lung cancer from PS, especially that during childhood.\\nand adolescence.\\nMethods Using household exposure to tobacco smoke as an estimate of PS, a 1.1 paired case-control study was\\nconducted in Harbin, China. We interviewed 114 female pomary lung cancer cases, aged 30-69 years, and the\\nhospital-based controls. The controls were non-cancer patients, selected from the same hospital as the cases, and\\nmatched on age (± 5 years), residential area and smoking status over their lifetime. There were 59 pairs who ever\\nsmoked and 55 pairs who never smoked. Information on PS was collected by residence for each of the following:\\npenis 0-6, 7-14, 15--22.23-30 and 31-69 years.\\nRes\\nHousehold PS significantly increases the risk of female lung cancer for those exposed at ages 22 or younger.\\nwho have ever smoked. The risk was also increased for those non-smoking pairs when exposed under the age of 13\\nyears. Exposure to maternal smoking at ages 14 or younger increased the risk by about 170% (odds ratio, OR 27.\\n95% confidence interval [Ctj: 1.49--1.58), but not to paternal smoking (OR 1.40, 95%CI 0.92-2 50). The risk was\\nnighest for those expused under the age of seven (OR 3.46. 95%CI: 1.80-6.65) and was also significant at ages 7-14\\n(OR 3.08, 95%CI: 1.62-5.57) and 15-22 (OR.3 10. 95%CI: 1.62-6.31) years Under the age of 23 years, the OR\\nincreased will amount of PS(P< 0.001). Of note, the OR in all live exposure perioos fornon-smoking pairs were similar\\nTo those for all 114 pairs studied.\\nConclusions Household PS. particularly that during childhood, increases the risk of female lung cancer. The\\nassessment of PS should be done by different periods of exposure.\\n1-0\\nThere is increasing evidence suggesting that involuntary\\nor passive smoking (PS) increases the risk of lung can\\ncer.

With this\\nin mind, preparations were made to test the effect of\\ngarette smoke on the lungs of more than one species\\naf laboratory animals.\\nThe Literature in this field is conspicuous for its\\ncarcity. The only experiment known to me was per-\\nformed by Lorenz et al. (1) and reported at the 35th\\nannual meeting of the American Association of Cancer\\nResearch. Lorenz and his associates exposed strain\\n\"A\" mice to tobacco smoke for 23-250 days in an espe-\\ndally designed smoking machine. The maximum ex-\\nposure was 693 hr.

Several concentrations\\nof Nimethylputrescine were therefore supplied to roots\\ngrown an organ culture in order to investigate the effect of\\nN-methylputrescine on root growth and oxidase enzymic\\nproduction. At concentrations up to 2.9 mM, N-methyl-\\nputrescine stimulated root growth (for wet weight see\\nTable 1. This was accompanied by a small increase in\\nnecdic activity of oxidase enzyme, although the total\\namount of extracted enzyme increased in line with the\\nincreased yields of root tissue. Even at a concentration of\\nN-methylputrescine which was inhibitory to root growth\\n(11.5 mM). the specific activity of the enzyme was not\\nincreased. Therefore, no evidence was found for a specific\\neffect of an inhibitory level of substrate on enzyme\\nactivity in this case. The observed stimulation of root\\ngrowth by N-methylputrescine might be explained by the\\nchemical reaction catalysed by an amine oxidase:\\nMcNHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH¸NH¸ + H¸O+O,\\n- M¢NHCH,CHỊCH CHO HẠO NHI\\nThus, N-methylputrescine could be used as a direct and\\nenergetically inexpensive source of nitrogen in the form of\\nammonia. Furthermore, demethylation of N-methyl-\\nputrescine could provide a second primary amine for the\\nproduction of ammonia. Maximum stimulation of reot\\ngrowth and oxidase production occurred at 1.15 mM N-\\nmethylputrescine. A comparison between the metabolism\\nof roots in unsupplemented medium, and in medium\\nsupplemented with 1.15 mM.

    "text": "N\\nNITROSAMINES\\nThe chemistry of nitrosation of amines in foods is a com-\\nplex process in which oxides of nitrogen (in oxidation\\nstates +3 and +4) formed during food processing, preser-\\nvation, and preparation can react with amino compounds\\nand other nucleophiles to produce N., C., O-, and S-nitroso\\ncompounds. The two major sources of oxides of nitrogen\\n(nitrosating agents) result from (1) the addition of nitrate\\nand/or nitrite to foods and (2) the heating and/or drying of\\nfoods in combustion gases in which molecular nitrogen\\ncan be oxidized to oxides of nitrogen. The only common\\nfeature of all N-nitroso compounds is the presence of the\\nN-N=0 functional group. Consequently, a wide range\\nof chemical and physical properties exist for N-nitroso\\ncompounds, depending on the substitution on the amine/\\namide nitrogen.\\nThe occurrence of N-nitroso compounds in foodstuffs.\\nprobably represents the most comprehensively researched\\nexposure situation for any class of genotoxic carcinogenic\\ncompounds in the human diet due to the possible link\\nbetween various human cancers and exposure to N-ni-\\ntroso compounds (1). Almost 80% of all N-nitroso com-\\npounds tested induce cancer in experimental animals, and\\nsome representative compounds of this class induce cancer\\nin at least 40 different animal species including higher\\nprimates (2). Tumors induced in experimental animals re-\\nsemble their human counterparts with respect to both\\nmorphological and biochemical properties. Extensive ex-\\nperimental and some epidemiological data suggest that\\nhumans are susceptible to carcinogenesis by N-nitroso\\ncompounds (1,3).\\nCHEMISTRY OF NITROSATION\\nThe classic method for producing a nitresating agent is\\nthe reaction between nitrite ions (NO₂\") with protons (H*\\nor H₂O) to give nitrous acid (HONO). Neither nitrite or\\nnitrous acid per se are nitrosating agents, but are inter-\\nmediates in the formation of the nitrosating agents dini-\\ntrogen trioxide (NO), dinitrogen tetraoxide (N₂04) and\\nthe nitrous acidium ion (H₂O+NO) as shown in Figure 1.\\nThe acidity of the aqueous medium determines the rela-\\ntive proportions of the nitrosating species. Under moder-\\nately acidic conditions (pH 2-5) all three nitrosating spe-\\ncies are present. At moderate pH (ca 3.0), N20 is the\\npredominant nitrosating agent ective in the nitrosation of\\nsecondary amines. At low pH (<2.0), H₂O*NO is the pre-\\ndominant agent for nitrosation reactions involving\\nweakly basic amines and amides.\\nPrimary amines are generally not considered to be pre-\\ncursors of N-nitrosamines, as nitrosation reactions gener-\\nally proceed via diazotization and nucleophilic replace-\\nment of the amino group. However, nitrosation of the\\nsimplest aliphatic amine, methylamine, results in a com-\\nplex mixture of products that include N-nitrosodimethyl-\\namine (NDMA). Nitrosation of higher primary aliphatic\\namines does not result in the formation of N-nitroso com-\\npounds.\\nNitrosation of secondary amines is second order in\\nterms of the concentration of nitrous acid and first order in\\nterms of the amine concentration in which only the unpro-\\ntonated amine reacts. Therefore, the reaction is strongly\\npH dependent. Strongly basic amines (eg, morpholine) are\\nnitroaated to the full extent at ca pH 3.4. Introduction of\\nionizable groups near to the nitrosatable amino moiety\\nreduces the basicity of the amine and the pH maxima for\\nnitrosation is reduced to ca pH 2.5, as in the case of amino\\nacids such as proline, sarcosine and hydroxyproline. For\\nweakly basic amines (eg, N-alkylaromatic amines), nitro-\\nsation by N₂Oy is very slow but proceeds more rapidly\\nwith the more reactive nitrosating species H₂O*NO and\\nNO at low pH.\\nTertiary amines present a rather complex situation in\\nwhich simple trialkylamines react slowly with nitrous\\nNO\\n-H*\\nHONO\\nH₂O*NO\\n+H+\\n+H⭑\\nNO + NO₂\\nN203\\n+\\nNO₂\\nH₂O\\n1971\\n2060547850\\nFigure 1.

Since\\nboth glucocorticoid steroids (9,10) and dehydroepiandrosterone\\n(DHEA) (11) block TPA promotion of skin tumurs, we have\\npostulated that elevated levels of adrenoconical steroids in\\nresponse to reduced food intake mediate the tumor inhibitory\\neffect of food restriction (12).\\nWe have used a carcinogen-induced lung adenoma model\\nin A mee to further explore the effect of adrenalectomy on\\nthe tumor inhibitory effect of food resuction.

Emphysema\\nEmphysema is defined as dilation of air spaces with accompanying destruction of\\nalveolar walls The current concept of the pathogenesis of emphysema is generally\\nreferred to as the \"protease-antiprotease theory\". This concept holds that the lung is\\nconstantly exposed to a variety of proteases which are balanced by an antiprotease\\nscreen, the most important of which is op-antitrypain. While this antiprotease screen\\nis sufficient in most individuals, in certain circumstances it is ineffective or the protease\\nburden is too great and lung tissue destriction results.\\nThe evidence favoring this theory is overwhelining. His most important support, de-\\nrives from the association of panacinar emphysenza with o. antirrypsin deficiency and\\nfrom the induction of emphysema by proteases in experigiental amiciais. For details,\\nthe reader is referred to the chapter by Kuhn in this text as well as several other re-\\nviewɛ; we will concentrate on the changes in lung connecuve tissue content and\\nmetabolism in humun and experimental enipily semmia.\\nMost interest in connective tissue abnormalities in emphysema has focused on the\\nelastic liber. There are several reasons for this, including\\n1\\n2.\\n3.\\nThe characteristic physiologic abnormality of emphysema is loss of elastic recoil\\nthroughout the volume range (1.c., the state deflation volume-pressure curve is\\nshifted to the left); this is consistent with a loss or break in the elastic fibers of\\nthe alveolar structures.\\nLight microscopic evaluation of human emphysematous lung demonstrates frag\\nmentation of elastic fiberS\\nThe best animal model of human emphysema results from the intratracheal in-\\nstillation of elastase: this model can be mimicked with other enzymes, which\\nmust be capable of digesting chantin\\nIt is important to realize, however, that no matter how compelling the indirect evi-\\ndence that abnormalities in clastic fibers are central in the pathogenesis of emphysema.\\nthere are few human data that directly support this concept there have been very few\\nmorphologic studies of emphysematous tung connective tissue at the ultrastructural\\nlevel; those that have been carried out repere changes in collagen, but nok elastic\\nfibers. Mos biochemical studies have faded to find alterations in elastis content in\\ncosphysematous lung. The one exception is the study by Mandl et al.\" in which\\nlung clustin was diminished in the partuchynia of individuals with emphysema. It has\\nbeen suggested that the elastin present in taphysematous lung may differ (coin normal\\nlung elastin in amino acid content, but such changes may reflect technical prob\\nleas in isolating tact, purified clustus ihan is representative of the bulk of the elastic\\nlibers present.\\nAlthough biochemical methodologies have not yielded direct evidence to support the\\nconcept that abouomalities of elastic fibers are central to the pathogenesis of this dụ-\\ncase, this does not mican that the overall concept is incorrect.

This recommendation was based\\non several different developments over the last fif-\\nteen years:\\n1)\\n!!!\\nThi\\nThe association between sensitization to for-\\neign proteins or allergens has become very\\nwell accepted. From studies in many parts of\\nthe world. it is clear that this association is\\nwith indoor allergens rather than with pol-\\nlens. Indeed, the data have reached a point\\nwhere it is almost certain that indoor aller-\\ngens are an important cause of asthma (1, 2,\\n3). As a corollary of this, it seems extremely\\nlikely that changes in houses during the\\nperiod 1940-1970 have been an important\\ncontributing cause of the increased preva-\\nlence, morbidity, and mortality from asthma.\\nConclusive evidence has been presented that\\nasthma is an inflammatory disease of the\\nbronchi, with a characteristic form of in-\\nflammation that includes cosinophils, mast\\ncells, and T cells. Furthermore, it is clear that\\ninhalation of allergens or local challenge of\\nthe bronchi of allergic individuals can pro-\\nduce both physiological changes in the lung\\ntypical of asthma and an inflammation that\\nis very similar to that of naturally occurring\\nasthma (4-6)\\nSince 1980, there have been rapid increases in\\nour understanding of the major indoor aller-\\ngens. Following the purification of Der p 1.\\nthere followed the purification, cloning, and\\ndevelopment of monoclonal antibodies to a\\nlarge series of indoor allergens, particularly\\nthose from dust mites, cats, dogs, and cock-\\nroaches. The development of monoclonal\\nantibodies and assays has made it possible to\\nmeasure exposure and to evaluate quantita-\\nsively measures proposed to control exposure\\n(2.7-10).\\nThe result has been an almost complete change in\\nour understanding of the role of allergens in\\nasthma. In particular, it is clear that allergens can\\nproduce inflammatory change in the lungs and\\nthat chronic exposure is likely to be an important\\ncause of both inflammation and the associated\\nbronchial hyper-reactivity. Perhaps the strongest\\nevidence for this comes from avoidance studies\\nwhere it has been shown by several different\\ngroups that prolonged reduction of exposure to\\nallergens can not only reduce symptoms of asthma\\nbut can decrease non-specific bronchial reactivity\\n(11-16) Overall, the conclusion is that indoor\\nallergen exposure is the commonest cause of in-\\nflammation of the lungs and that reducing ex-\\nposure should be a central part of the manage-\\nment.\\nThe Association between Sensitization and\\nAsthma\\nThat patients could be allergic to autologous\\nhouse dust was well known prior to 1964: however,\\n5\\n2505443580",

Salmon\\nMargaret Winberg\\nVernon T. Oi\\nDavid Buck\\nBecton Dickinson Monoclonal Center, Mountain View, California 94039\\nI. Introduction\\nThe CD4 (Leu3/T4) lymphocyte antigen, expressed on helper T-cells and\\nmacrophages, appears to be involved in restriction of antigen reactive T-cells to\\nClass II hearing antigen presenting cells and may in fact mediate that restriction\\n(reviewed in [2]). Antibodies to murine CD4 (L3T4) have been used successfully\\nto treat murine autoimmune diseases [1][27][28]. In addition, anti-L3T4\\nantibodies, co-administered with antigen, result in antigen-specific tolerance [6].\\nSuch treatments may have implications for human autoimmune disease and\\ntransplantation therapies. In most model systems, a single rat monoclonal anti-\\nL3T4 antibody, GK1.5 [7] has been utilized. In considering similar in vivo\\napplications in primates and humans, it may be important to use anti-CD4\\nantibodies that mimic GK1.5 as closely as possible, particularly with respect to\\nreactivity with the equivalent region (epitope) of the human CD4 molecule.\\nA particular interest in human CD4 epitopes stems from its role as the receptor\\nfor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [8][12]. The binding of HIV to CD4\\nhas suggested an anti-idiotype vaccine strategy utilizing anti-CD4 antibodies as\\nimmunogens (reviewed in [29]). Immunization with such an anti-CD4\\nmonoclonal antibody (or antibodies) may generate anti-idiotypic responses\\ncapable of neutralizing HIV and preventing infection. In theory, this approach\\nwould be applicable to multiple HIV isolates since the CD4 binding site on gp120\\nEs conserved [25]. Identification of an anti-CD4 antibody reactive with an epitope\\nidentical to or overlaping the HIV gp120 binding site would be an initial step in\\nsuch a strategy. Cross-bincking studies have partitioned anti-CD4 antibodies into\\nmultiple epitope clusters [21][22][4], but steric interference between wo\\nantiboxftes binding to very different regions of the primary sequence cannot be\\ndistinguished from their binding to near or overlapping epitopes. We have\\ncomplemented antibody cross-blocking and recombinant HIV rgp120 (rgp120)\\n[15] blocking studies by using a bacterial recombination system with human and\\nmouse CD4 cDNA's to generate chimeric CD4 molecules.

Twenty-six adolescent male baboons\\nunderwent surgical preparation, of which 2 underwent\\nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion. Four addi-\\ntional animals served as nonsurgical controls. Peripheral\\nvenous blood specimens were taken for performing as-\\nsays of leukocyte function at defined intervals before and\\nafter both the surgical preparation (i.e., the overall pro-\\ncedure for implantation of the middle cerebral artery oc-\\nclusion device) and occlusion/reperfusion. A stress-\\nrelated elevation in total leukocyte number was attributed\\nmainly to an increase in the number of circulating PMN\\nleukocytes. Values rose from 13.9 ± 4.9 × 10 to 27.8 ±\\n5.8×10 (±SD;21) for total leukocyte number.\\nwith p <0.001, and from 4.3 ± 2.1 x 10 to 15.9 ± 4.7 x\\n10%) (21) for PMN leukocytes. with p < 0.001.\\nSurgical preparation had no effect p\\n0.4) on the ability\\nof PMN leukocytes, isolated 24 h after the implantation\\nprocedure, to display polarization, O¯ production, or\\nG-glucuronidase release when stimulated with human\\nC5a.

Muscarinic\\nresponses are observed in the central and peripheral nervous\\nsystem as well as in muscle and in glands and represent a large\\nproportion of the acetylcholine-mediated effects. Due to the\\nextraordinarily high number of AChRs found in the post-\\nsynaptic membrane of the electromotor synapses of electric\\nfish, knowledge of the mechanism and structure of AChRs\\nhas increased tremendously in recent years (Changeux, 1981).\\nAdvances in research on mAChits have been much less rapid.\\nThis is due to the lower concentration of mAChRs, together\\nwith the fact that these receptors have not yet been purified.\\nEarlier radioligand binding studies revealed that mAChRs\\nare discrete membrane components which recognize an-\\ntagonist and agonist molecules (Gorissen et al., 1978; Birdsall\\net al., 1979: Haga, 1980). As is the case with many other\\nreceptor systems, the two types of ligands appear to differ in\\ntheir mechanisms of interaction in the following way: only\\nagonists induce receptor desensitization in intact cell prepara-\\ntions (Klein er af., 1979; Simon and Klein, 1979); the recep-\\ntois are composed of different subpopulations with the same\\naffinity for antagonists but different affinities for agonists\\n(Birdsall et al., 1978; Ehlert er af., 1981); guanine nucleotides\\n*To whom repeat requests should be sent.\\nINS Press Limited, Oxford, England.\\nand Mg+ ions have opposite effects on agonist affinity but\\nno effect on antagonis binding (Entert et al., 1981; Wei and\\nSulakhe, 1980; Sokolovsky et al., 1980); and finally, agonists\\nbut not antagonists induce conformational changes in the\\nreceptors (Vauquelin et al., 1982).\\nmAChRs have been successfully solubilized with a wide\\nvariety of detergents, of which digitonin appears to be the\\nmost effective (Gorissen et al., 1981; Ruess and Lichlander.\\n1979; Hurko, 1978; Aaronstam et al., 1978; Repke and Mat-\\nthies, 1980). An affinity gel with high affinity for mAChRs\\n(Repke et al., 1980) has been described recently and a\\npurification of hydrophobic mAChR and nAChR proteins\\nwas attempted earlier (Barrantes et al., 1975).

CxT24n6o8 tumors\\nAbstract\\nThe function of proteases in brain tumor urvasion is currently not well established. For tuntors of epithelial\\nand fibromatous origin collagenase production can enhance the invasive capacity of cells to penetrate base-\\nment membranes. We showed previously that a c-la-ras transformed glial cell line (Cx124neu) invaded\\nhamaster brain tissue in vivo. These cells were also capable of invading reconstituted basement membrane and\\nembryonic chick hearts in vitro. Since the histopathology of CxT24neo3 tumors munics that of glioblastoma\\nmultiforme in humans, CXT24neo3 was used as the model in vitro for this type of brain tumor. Presently, we\\ndetected by zymogram analysis a gelatinase that was secreted by CxT24a003 and that had an apparent mole-\\ncular mass of 62 XD.\\nTo verily whether gelatinase affected invasion in vitro of these glial cells we determined the efficacy of a\\nsubstrate specific collagenase inhibitor on invasion in vitro. GM6410] is a synthetic polypeptide that specificat-\\nly occupies the substrate binding sites of metalloprotease. Since this drug did not show cytotoxicity, its specific-\\nity for metalloprotease is a valuable tool to evaluate the physiological function of these enzymes on invasion.\\nWe found that treatment of CxT24neo3 with GM6001 reduced the fraction of invading CxTacos cells\\nthrough reconstituted basement membrane. These data suggest thai metalloproteases can stimulate bran\\ntumor invasion.\\nIntroduction\\nCurrent anticancer therapy is mainly directed\\nagainst the uncontrolled proliferation of tomor\\ncells. Although this approach leads to successful\\ntreatment of primary tumors (1.2), is bas little influ-\\nence on invasion and metastasis. The latter aspects\\nof malignancy refer to the property of malignant to\\nmor cells to penetrate and destroy surrounding tis-\\nsue and to grow at a location distant from the pri-\\nmary tumor. Since invasion and metastasis are re-\\nsponsible for the morbidity of cancer patients, new\\ntherapeutic approaches will be necessary to specifi\\ncally reduce the dissemination of malignant tumor\\ncells (for review soc: 3).\\nMalignani primary brain tumors are peculiar\\nsince they rarely inetastasize to ectopic loci but dis-\\nplay malignancy by invading the surrounding brain\\nrissue [4,5].

SCLAFANI AND WaitỌN L. FANGMAN\\nDeputed at Genetics SA-50, reverday of Washington. Seank, WA 98HA\\nCommunicated by A. H. Deernamin. May 31, 1984\\nABSTRACT The herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine\\nkinase gene 7K complements the defect in five temperature-\\nSensitive mutants and in vitro constructed insertion and dele-\\ntion mutants of the CDCS gene of Nuccharomyces cerevisiae.\\nThe herpes thymidine kinase enzyme acts as both a thymidine\\nkinase and a thymidylate kinase (dTMP kinase). The latter\\nactivity is responsible for the cdc& complementation since all\\nthermosensitive edes mutants are deficient in dTMP kinase ac\\ntivity at all temperatures. However, an intrugenic revertant,\\ncach-320, which was selected by demanding mitotic growth at\\nthe restrictive remperature, exhibits thermolabile ¿TMP ki-\\nnase activity. We conclude that CDCS is the structural gene for\\ndTMP kinase, which catalyzes an essential step in DNA pre-\\ncursor biosynthesis. Previously, it had heen snown that the\\nDNA replication defect of eded mutants could not be bypassed\\nby the addition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to per-\\nmeabilized cells. This apparent discrepancy can be explained\\nby hypothesizing a multiprotein yeast DNA replication com-\\nplex containing the CDCS protein.\\nThe product of the CDC8 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae\\nauts during the S phase of the yeast cell cycle (1, 2). Teen-\\nperature-sensitive edo mutans are defective in chromo-\\nsomal, mitochondrial and 2-um plasmid DNA replication (1-\\n5) at the restrictive température. Most alteles of eded also\\nbave a mutant phenotype at the permissive temperature:\\nthey exhibit an increase in spontaneous mitochondrial DNA\\nmunability (6) and a decrease in ultraviolet light-induced ma-\\ntaenesis (7). These properties of edes mutants are consist-\\nent with a defect either in an essential replication protein,\\nsaich as a DNA polymerase, or in a DNA precursor pathway.\\nThe later possibility, however, appeared to be eliminated\\nbecause thermolabile replication could not be bypassed in\\neither permeabilized cells (8, 91 or a cell-free system (9–11)\\nby providing the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. In\\nthis communication, we provide evidence that CDC8 is. in\\nfact the structural gene for an enzyme of DNA precursor\\nbrasynthesis, thymidylate kinase (dTMP kinase).\\nIn vitro complementation assays have been used previous-\\ndy to isolate proteins that were thought to be the CDC87\\ngene product (8, 111.

Deparment of Chemistry. Rochester. MET 489-1404.\\nLISA\\nRecent evidence has suggested that unsaturated carbonyl\\ncompounds may be the ultimate mitogens produced from the\\nprimary auto-oxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids.\\nThe present study has investigated the metabolism of\\n13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-ROOH) by rat colon\\nhomogenates. This hydroperoxide is one of the primary\\nproducts formed from the oxygenation of linoleic acid, the\\nmust abundant dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid, Incubation\\nmixtures contained [1-C)13-ROOF and colonic homogenates\\nprepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats. After 30 min of\\nincubation the reaction was quenched and the products\\nextracted for analysis by HPLC. The identity of the eluted\\nproducts were verified by UV, MS and NMR spectroscopy.\\nThe major products include a mixture of isomers of\\n2.4-dienone Cg fatty acids and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic\\nacid. Direct comparison of homogenate metabolism to the\\nhernatin-catalyzed, alkoxyl radical-mediated decomposition\\nof 13-ROOH shows some significant differences. In\\nparticular, no epoxy products are detected in the presence\\nof tissue homogenates whereas these are the major products\\nobserved during the decomposition of 13-ROOH by heatin\\nand a number of other agents. These experiments demonstrate\\nthe production of relatively large amounts of unsaturated\\ncarbonyl-containing fatty acids during the metabolism of\\nFy droperoxy fatty acids by colonic tissue. The major product,\\n13-oxo-97.11E-octadecadienoic acid, when instilled intra-\\nrectally stimulates the incorporation of 'Hideoxythymidine\\ninto colonic mucosal DNA, and induces colonic mucosal\\nornithine decarboxylase activity in vivo. These findings have\\nimportant implications for the mechanism by which dietary\\nfat promotes colon tumorigenesis as the formation of relatively\\nreactive 2.4-dienones may be a key to the in vivo mitogenic\\nactivity of oxidized fatty acids.\\nIntroduction\\nIn a number of organ systerns it has been suggested there is a\\nconnection between high intakes of dietary far and an increased\\ndevelopment of cancer (1). The precise mechanism for this effect\\nis currently the subject of active investigation and, in fact, the\\nmechanism may differ depending on the organ systont under\\nconsideration. For example. in the colen. biliary steroids\\nproduced in response to the ingestion of dietary fat have been\\nsuggested to play a role in this phenomenon (2).

On the basis of a number\\nof lines of reasoning we have suggested that an 2,5-unsaturated\\nketone is the ultimate mitogen formed from the products of fay\\nacid oxygenation (51.\\nThe initial products of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation are\\nhydroperoxy fatty acids (7).

GOSWAMI. MARY ELLEN MARTIN,\\nAND M. A. Q. SIDDIQUI\\nDepartment of Anatomy and Cell Biology, State University of New York\\nHealth Science Center, Brooklyn, New York 11203\\nReceived 7 February 1992 Returned for modification 4 April 1992/Accepted 20 November 1992\\nWe have identified a serain-responsive, cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor, BB-1, that recognizes an\\nAT-rich sequence element B), identical to the myocyte enhancer factor (MEP-2) target site, in the cardiac\\nmyosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) promoter. Deletion of the clement B sequence alone from the cardise MLC-2\\npromoter causes, as does that of the MEF-2 site from ather promuters and the enhancer of skeletal muscle\\ngenes, a marked reduction of transcription. BBP-I is distinguishable from cardiac MEF-2 on the basis of\\nimmunoprecipitation with an antibody which recognizes MEF-2 but not BBF-1. Unlike ME-2, BBF-t is\\npresent exclusively in nuclear extracts from cardiac muscle cells cultured in a medium containing high\\nconcentration of serum. Removal of serum from culture medium abolishes BBF-1 activity selectively with a\\nconcomitant fuss of the positive regulatory effect of element B on MLC-2 gene transcription, indicating that\\nthere is a correlation between the BBF-1 binding activity and the tissue-specific role of the element B (MEF-2\\nsite) sequence. The loss of element B-mediated activation of transcription is reversed following the refeeding of\\ncells with serum-containing medium. These data demonstrate that cardiac muscle cells contain two distinct\\nprotein factors, MEF-2 and BBF-1, which bind to the same target site but that, unlike MEF-2, BBP-1 is seruia\\ninducible and cardiac tissue specibe, BBF-t thus appears to be a crucial member of the MEF-2 family of\\nproteins which will serve as an haportant toul in understanding the regulatory mechanismist underlying\\ncardiogenic differentiation.\\nThe expression of cardiac musete genes during myogene.\\nsis is influenced by a plethora of factors, including serum and\\ngrowth factors (15, 18, 23, 27, 40, 45). Although recent work\\nas established that these agents exert their effects directly,\\nor indirectly, on transcription of target genes, the molecular\\nevents involved in production of the cardiac phenotype and\\ndifferenuation of the cardiac myoblast remain to be eluci\\ndated. The expression of cardiac muscle genes is activated\\nby serum and serum growth factors in culture medium (10),\\n451, while removal of growth factors is obligatory for differ-\\nentiation and activation of gene transcription in skeletal\\nmuscle cells (14). Scrum induces an early growth response\\ngene, Egr-1, which can trans-activate the cardiac e-myosin\\nheavy chain la-MHC) gene in a transfection assay (18). I\\ngeneral, serum-induced regulation of muscle-specific genes\\nis mediated by serum response elements and serum response\\nelemeat-related sequences which serve as target sites for\\nbinding of serum response factors (SRF) and SRF-related\\nfactors (36 and references therein), suggesting that serio\\nand serum growth factors play a pivotal role in control of\\nmyogenic differentiation.\\nThe issue-specific expression of cardine muscle genes is\\nmediated by several cis elements in the respective genus and\\nthe cognate trans-acting regulatory factors (15, 18, 22, 41,\\n51. 521. The lack of expression of the chicken cardiac myosin\\nlight chain-2 (MLC-2) gene in skeletal muscle cells is due to\\na negative regulatory mechanism mediated by an upstream\\npromotes element, CSS, and its binding proteins present an\\nskeletal muscle cells (41). Another group of researchers (33.\\nCorresponding author.\\n52) has described an activator element (HF-1) in the rat\\ncardiac tissue-specific MLC-2 promoter which is implicated\\nin cardiac tissue-specific gene transcription. A 47-bp element\\nm the cardiac troponin T (en) gene containing a 10-hp\\nAT-rich sequence, conserved in both chicken and rat cardine\\nM.C-2 genes, is also involved in cardine tissue-specific\\ntranscription (22). However, proteins that recognize the AT\\nelement in the TRT promoter are present in both muscle and\\nnonmuscle cells.\\nWe have recently described (38) an activator, element A\\n(CCAAAACTGG), in the cardiac MLC-2 gene similar to the\\nevolutionarily conserved CAro sequence responsible for\\nup-regulation of muscle genes (29, 30). The CAr box\\nsequence, however, interacts with multiple nuclear proteins\\n(19, 26, 29–31), including the ebiquitous SRF which are\\ninvolved m activation of both skeletal and cardiac muscle\\ngene transcription (2, 5, 19, 26, 31, also see reference 39 for\\na review). A second AT-rich sequence, clement B, in the\\nMLC-2 promoter is indistinguishable from the consensus\\n(C/TYT[A/T](A/T)AAATA(A/G} sequence present in a num\\nher of muscle gene promotees and enhancers which are\\nrecognized by the myocyte-specific enhancer binding tactor\\n(MEF-2), originaly identified in extracts of a skeletal muscle\\ncell line, C2 (17).

Many of the companies that produce\\nthem doubt that it will ever be possible to replace experiments on animals\\nPhil Botham and lain Purchase\\nTHE manufacturers of industrial, agricul-\\ntural and pharmaceutical chemicals are\\ncaught in the crossfire of a major social\\nconflict. While there is an ever-increasing\\ndentand for absolute safety, the challenge\\n15 to use fewer (or even no) animals\\nin experiments. Toxicologists have long\\naccepted that both concerns are legitimate\\nand have been striving to find practical\\nways of dealing with these issues.\\nToxicologists attempt to identify and understand toxic hazards,\\nto assess the risk to the environment or to individuals exposed\\nto chieaucals. Virtually every chemical presents some coxic hazard,\\neven if only at very high doses. Toxicology helps to identify\\nthose materials that are unsuitable for use in certain products\\nor situations and defines concentrations of substances that\\ncan be used safely in others. Too cautious an approach could\\nrestrict the development of valuable new products. But too\\ncasual an approach could allow the development of a product\\nthat damages the health of those exposed to it.\\nResearchers must therefore use the best available methods\\nto assess toxic hazards. In most cases, this means experiments\\non laboratory animals. Increasingly, toxicology draws on the\\nadvances in our understanding of\\nbasic biological science to define\\nthe mechanisms by which chemi-\\ncals exert their toxic effects, and\\nso improve the process of assessing\\nrisk. Understanding mechanisms\\ncan also lead to the development of\\nantidotes or safer alternatives.\\nBut it would be dishonest to claim\\nthat toxicology has always pro-\\ntected the public from the adverse\\neffects of chemicals. Accidental or\\ndeliberate exposure has seriously\\ndamaged people's health-for ex-\\nample, the birth defects caused by\\nThalidomide, the cancers caused by\\nbenzidine and the bizarre toxic\\nmanifestations of the toxic oil syn.\\ndrome. Appropriate toxicological\\nscreening could have prevented the\\nThalidomide and benzidine trag-\\nedies, and regulations have since\\nbeen improved to avoid a repetition\\nof such mistakes. For toxic oil there\\nis, as yet, no appropriate test.\\nToxicity testing in Britain is\\nconducted within the framework of\\ninternational guidelines such as\\nthose of the OECD (the \"club\" of\\nleading capitalist countries), good\\nlaboratory practice enforced by the\\n2 May 1992\\nDepartment of Health, and the 1986 Animals (Scientific\\nProcedures) Act controlled by the Home Office. But regulators\\nacknowledge that flexibility is often needed in assessing toxicity.\\nSo toxicologists have some leeway in deciding which tests are\\nperformed, although not in how they are performed. The\\ncombination of tests chosen depends on the circumstances. For\\nexample, if toxicity data are out of date for chemicals that have\\nbeen on the market for a number of years, tests may be needed to\\ncomplement the existing information from toxicity and epidemi-\\nological studies. On the other hand, for a new chemical, a com-\\nprehensive database of the chemical's toxicity will be built up.\\nA broad screening process will detect a variety of toxic end-\\npoints-signs of toxicity ranging from a mild rash to tumours\\nor even death and provide information on the doses that pro-\\nduce a toxic effect. For a pesticide or drug, 30 or 40 different\\ntoxicity studies are necessary to cover all the significant areas\\nof potential concern.\\nMost experiments are carried out on rats and mice, although\\nother species are used for specific end-points. Where chroruc, long-\\nterm, toxicity data on a non-rodent species is required, dogs are\\ncomntenly used. Eye irritation studies are frequently carried out\\non rabbits, while guinea pigs are appropriate for allergy testing.\\nThe first step in investigating a new chemical is a search of\\nthe published literature to see what is already known about it.\\nA study of the physicochemical properties will reveal whether\\nthe chemical is likely to be toxic-\\nfor instance, if it is a strong acid or\\nbase likely to irritate the skin and\\neyes. Preliminary in vitro testing-\\ntests, for instance, that use cells or\\ntissue growing in culture rather\\nthan living animals-can identify\\nthose chemicals likely to irritate or\\ncorrode living tissue. In many cases\\nthe chemical can then be aban-\\ndoned Or the preliminary informa\\ntion can be used to modify further\\ntests on animals. For example, only\\none animal would be dosed with\\nthe chemical and, if adverse effects.\\noccurred, a lower dose or more\\ndilute solution can be used for\\nfurther testing. By using this step\\nsequence approach the pain and\\ndistress that animals may experi\\nence is substantially reduced.\\nTypically 28-day and then 90-day\\nstudies are carried out. The data on\\nthe toxicity of the chemicals are\\ngradually built up to the point\\nwhere the long-term studies that\\ncan detect chronic toxicity and\\ncarcinogenicity can be designed\\nwith some confidence.

The majority of\\nbuman cancer cases are caused by environmental, occupational and\\nrecreational exposures to carcinogens (I). These carcinogens can\\naffect one or muitple stages of carcinogenesis through both genetic\\nand epigenetic mechanisms (2-4). Capcer risk assessment, a highly\\nvisible discipline in the field of public health, has historically relied on\\nclassical qudemiology, chronic unimui bioassays of potentai curcin-\\nagens, and the mathematical modeling of these epidemiological and\\nlaboratory findings (5). Public health regulators are forced to steer a\\npredeat course of conservative usk assessicent because of the limited\\nknowledge of the complex pathobiological processes during carcino-\\ngenetic differences in die metabolisia of carcinogens and DNA repair\\ncapacities, variable genomic stability among animal species, and\\nvariation among individuals with inherited cancer predispositio\\nmake a definiave analysis of cancer risk extremely difficult A mo-\\nlecular epidemiological approach integrates molecular biology, in\\nvitro and in viso laboratory models, and biochemistry and epidemi-\\nology to infer individual cancer risk (6-9). Achieving this goal is\\nchallenging both current molecular technologies and the spideatio\\nlogical designs used to resolve bucethical dilemmas (10. 1).\\nThe two major facets of the molecular epidemiology of buman\\ncancer risk are die assessment of carcinogen exposure, including\\nbiomarkers of effect, and the inherited or acquired cost cancer sus-\\nceptibility factors (reviewed in Refs. 12 and 13); bes. it is the\\ngene-cavumacar unteraction that determines an individual's cancer\\nrisk (Fig. . Whereas the external environment is a major source of\\ncarcinogens, the cellular microenvironment also contains endogenous\\ncarcinogens including oxyradicals gencrated by cancer-prone chronic\\ninflammatory diseases. Kinzler and Vogelstein (14) bave further clas\\nsifted cancer suscepubility genes as gatekeepers and caretakers (dis-\\ncussed below).\\nThe gene-envirequent paradigm can improve cancer risk assess-\\nment When combined with carcinogen bioassay in laboratory ani-\\nmals, laboratory studies of molecular carcinogenesis. und classical\\nepidemiology, molecular epidemiology can contribute to the four\\ntraditional aspects of cancer risk assessment: (a) hazard identification:\\n(b) dose-response assessment; (c) exposure assessment; and (2) risk\\ncharacterization (Fig. 2).

Therefore, the uncertainty of the current\\nindividual disk assessments and the limited availability of genetic\\ncounseling services dictate cantion and, many argue, the restriction of\\ngeneric testing to those conditions amenable to either preventative or\\nthempeutic intervention.\\nCancer Susceptibility Genes\\nAn intricately balanced control of cellular proliferance and death\\nmaintains normal risque homeostasis and is accomplished by a det\\nwork of genes. Many of these genes are implicated in the natural\\nhistory of human cancer because of dicir consistent alteration in most\\ntypes of buman cancer. The p53 cumer suppressor gene is a remark-\\nable example, because it is murated in about half of all cancer types\\narising from a variety of tissues, and missense mutations occur at a\\ntugh frequency (18-20). Other aunier suppressor genes that are im-\\nportant in hamus oncology, eg, APC, WTI, or NPT, seem to have a\\nmore limited tissue contribution (Table 1). In addition to the consid-\\nation of single genes, recent data indicate the importance of molec-\\nular pathways involving cancer susceptibility genes, c.ą,, plóink and\\nRb are involved in both the G, checkpoint pathway (21) and the\\nmolecular pathogenesis of many types of cancer (22), and APC and\\nB-catenin e involved in the instinting events in coten carcinogenesis\\n(23).\\nGermline mutations in genes, eg. p53, RB. p164, and APC.\\nhave been identified in rare cancer-prone families (Table 1). Somatie\\nvations in these genes are also frequently found in common spo\\nradic cancers, which arests to the value of studying rare familial\\ncancer syndromes. These cancer susceptibility genes encode proces\\nthat perform diverse cellular functions, including transcription, cell\\ncycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The increased cancer risk of\\nan individual carrying one of these germline mutations can be ex-\\ntraordinarily high, tau, more than 1000-fold in xeroderma piguncato-\\nsum (complementation group A-G: Fig. 3), where the \"at risk\" ailele\\nis infrequent in the general population. Whereas germline mutations in\\ngence involved in carcinogen metabolism increase cancer risk only\\nseveralfold, on at risk allele can be very common, eg, GSTMI\\n(obewering in about 50% in the Caucasmo population), thus anakung\\nthe unbatable cancer risk substantial.\\nCaretaker and Gatekeeper Genes\\nRecently, the concept of gatekeeper and caretaker genes character-\\nized by their control of net cellular proliferation or maintenance of\\ngenonue integrity, respectively, has been introduced (14, 24).

In control animals,\\npilocarpine (1-100 µg kg ) ihibited and gallariae (0.1-10 mg kg. iv.) potentiated vagally-\\ninduced brouchoconstriction by stimulating or blecking My muscarinic receptors on the vagus.

The disure\\nof heparin to restore M; receptor function demonsumtes that the leukocyte-dependent loss of Ma\\nreceptor junction is not mediated by positively charged inflammatory cell proteins.\\nKeywords: Virus; prasympathetic nerves; vagus nerves; muscarinic receptors; airway inflammation; airway smooth muscle;\\nasthma: cyclophosphamide; pilocarpine; geltemice\\nIntroduction\\nAsthma exacerbations are frequently the result of viral air-\\nway infections (Welliver, 1983). Even in normal subjects,\\nviral infections increase airway resistance (Jobautoo et al.\\n1969) and unway responsiveness (Empey et al., 1976,\\nAquilina e, 1980).\\nMuch of this virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is\\nmediated by the vagus nerves as it is blocked by atropine\\n(Empoy et al., 1976; Aquilina et al., 1980). Furthermore, it is\\nthe activity of the efferent cholinergic nerves winch is in-\\npreased since bronchoconstriction induced by electrical\\nstimulation of these nerves is potentiated by viral infection\\n(Buder et al, 1985). There is no evidence that the My\\nmuscarinic receptors, which are responsible for alway\\nsmooth muscle contrection, are altered by viral infection\\n(Buckner er of, 1985; Jacoby et al, 1988; Dusser et cl,\\n1989). However, the My muscarinic receptors on the vagus\\nnerves in the Jung, which corraaily uhibit acetylcholine\\n(ACh) release (Fryer & Maclagan, 1984), are no longer func-\\ntional in virus infected guinea-pigs (Fryer & Jacoby, 1991).\\n\"Author for correspondence.\\nDysfunction of inhibitory M. muscarinic receptors may be\\ns direct effect of viral neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic\\nacid residues from the My receptors, thereby denensing\\nagonist affinity for the receptors (Fryer et al, 1990).\\nAlternatively, inflammatory cells and their products may be\\nimportant participants in loss of My receptor function. In\\nozone-exposed and in antigen-challenged guinea-pigs, deple\\ntion of inflammatory cells protects the function of the\\nneumaat My muscarinic receptors (Fryer & Jacoby, 1992;\\nGambone Fryer, 1992 Incaby et al., 1993). Furthermore,\\nadministering heparin to the antigen challenged guinea-pig\\nacutely restores neuronal My receptor function, probably by\\nbirding to and neutraining positively charged inflammatory\\ncell protins such as eosinophil major basic protein (Fryer &\\nJacoby. 1992; Jacoby er uh, 1993). In order to determine\\nwhether inflammatory cells are essential to virus-induced loss.\\nof neuronal M, muscarinic receptors, we tested the effect of\\nleakocyte depletion on My receptor function in parainfluenza\\nvirus-infected guinea-pigs. We also tested the effect of\\nheparin in virus-infected guinar-pigs that were not depleted\\nof leukocytes.\\n11053537\\nPUBLICATIONS 047047",
