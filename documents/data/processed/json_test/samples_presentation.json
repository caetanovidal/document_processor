Blankinship\\nThe definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a group of related technologies which\\nshare a common theme that of mimicking human reasoning or sensing suggests that Al can\\ncontribute to one's understanding of how the chemical senses interact with the external\\nenvironment and with internal cognitive processes. So, in response to the question: Is there\\nArtificial Intelligence in chemical sensing? - the answer is a \"definite maybe.\"\\nTo get right to the point, there are two areas in which techniques from Al can contribute\\nto an understanding of the chemical senses. It turns out that both of these areas involve a form of\\nAl called neural networks. The first area is the application of neurocomputing in the\\ndevelopment of artificial olfactory systems. This includes research conducted by Nakamoto and\\nMoriizumi at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in the development of artificial odor sensors,\\nwhich consist of a quartz-resonator array with different coating materials whose oscillation\\nfrequencies change when certain molecules are adsorbed onto its surface. The resulting patterns\\nare then recognized by a neural network to help identify the odor. Freeman and Burke at the\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley are conducting research into using neural networks for pattern\\nrecognition of the EEG activity at the olfactory bulb, and are also developing artificial neural\\nmodels of olfaction. This first area is mentioned mostly for the sake of completeness. The\\nsecond area, which will be the focus of my talk, is using the data mapping capabilities of neural\\nnerworks to help understand chemical sensing data.\\nA neural network is a self-adapting, parallel, distributed information processing structure\\nthat is loosely based on the interconnected web of neurons in the brain. Most neural networks.\\nparticularly those called mapping networks, can be more easily described as statistical mapping\\nor machine learning techniques which are inspired by the arrangement of neurons in the brain.\\nThis is a generic picture of what a neural network looks like. Instead of neurons in the brain, we\\nhave these nodes of a directed graph that are called processing elements. Analogous to the\\nsynapses between neurons in the brain, the processing elements are linked by unidirectional\\ninformation channels called connections. These connections can have mathematical data types,\\nand they may also be weighted - so that if, for example, the output of this PE is 4 and the weight\\non this connection is 0.2, then the input value to that PE is a 0.8. There are two main operating\\ngroundrules for a neural network: (1) a processing element may have multiple input connections,\\nbut can generate only a single output, and (2) all processing within a processing element must be\\ncompletely local. The functioning of a processing element is basically this: Solely as a function\\nof the current values of its inputs and some local memory values, it computes a number. That\\nsingle number becomes the output of the processing element. That output can branch out into\\n-B1-\\n2024847516",

The companies\\nbelieve that testing of this type should be handled by the federal government and that\\nthere should be national, uniform standards in this area, as the national tobacco tesolution\\nwould provide. This will give consumers across the country consistent and clear\\ninformation that they can understand.

EMBARKS ON A LONG-TERM,\\nCOMPREHENSIVE YOUTH SMOKING PREVENTION EFFORT\\nYouth Smoking Prevention Initiative Will Employ Four Strategies:\\nCommunication, Education, Community Action and Access\\nNEW YORK, November 30, 1998 -- Philip Morris U.S.A. is embarking on a substantiai,\\nlong-term youth smoking prevention effort. The comprehensive approach will integrate\\nfour different strategies: Communication, Education, Community Action and Access.\\nThese strategies are designed to work together to help prevent kids from starting to smoke.\\n\"Youth smoking is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution,” said\\nCarolyn Levy, Senior Vice President of Youth Smoking Prevention at Philip Morris\\nU.S.A. \"Many youth advocates agree that a comprehensive approach is needed that\\nintegrates communication, school-based and community-based programs, and access\\nprevention strategies.\"\\n\"The incidence of youth smoking is rising, and as the largest manufacturer of cigarettes in\\nthe U.S., we must do more to help prevent kids from starting to smoke. It is in the best\\ninterests of our employees, consumers and our shareholders that we take responsible action\\nto reduce youth smoking,\" said Levy. \"We are committed to measuring the impact of our\\nefforts and applying resources to programs that are the most promising.\"\\nFour Youth Smoking Prevention Strategies\\nThe first phase of Philip Morris U.S.A.'s Communication strategy consists of national\\ntelevision ads, scheduled to begin airing December 7. The ads are designed to convince\\nkids that smoking is not cool, and they do not need to smoke to define themselves.\\nTelevision commercials directed at kids ages 10-14 will appear on nationwide youth-\\noriented programming on such networks as ABC, WB, TNT, USA and Fox.\\n“Uulizing peer-to-peer communication, the ads celebrate adolescents' decisions not to\\nsmoke, to make smart decisions, to think for themselves, to stand up to peer pressure. The\\nads remind kids that the majority of their peers don't smoke,\" said Levy. \"The premise is\\nthat adolescents respond to positive reinforcement, rather than preaching, to continually\\nsustain their decision not to smoke.\"\\nConsistent with Philip Morris U.S.A.'s focus on applying resources to efforts that are\\neffective in reducing youth smoking, the Company conducted extensive research on these\\nads, asking kids if they understand the messages the ads communicate.\\n-more-\\n2071393786\\nMARLBORO BENSON & HELATES MERIT VIRGINIA SETMS PART IAMENT LIGHTS CAMBRIDGE ALPINE PLAYERS, SARATOGA",

This discussion has heightened\\nsince the major U.S. tobacco companies agreed to a comprehensive seulement with the\\nstates last November. The seulement provides the states approximately $200 billion in\\nnew funding over the next 25 years and the states must now decide how to spend this\\nmoney.\\nPhilip Morris believes the settlement provides the states an unprecedented opportunity to\\ndesign and implement programs that can reduce youth smoking. We hope that the states\\nwill devote a portion of their settlement funds to pay for a comprehensive state program\\nto reduce use of, and access to, tobacco products by minors.\\nThis kind of comprehensive effort would include advertising campaigns, education in\\nschools, community-based programs that promote positive youth development, and\\nenhanced access prevention and enforcement efforts.\\nIn 1998, Philip Morris U.S.A. created a Youth Smoking Prevention department whose\\ngoal is to develop and support programs to help reduce the incidence of youth smoking.\\nWe are devoting more than $100 million this year alone to a substantive and long-term\\neffort that will combine Communication, Education, Community Action and Access\\nPrevention initiatives. Philip Morris U.S.A. is committed to taking responsible action on\\nthis issue, just as we are sincerely committed to full compliance to both the spirit and the\\nletter of the Master Settlement Agreement with the states.

If one\\ncannot demonstrate that a product is capable of safer design, then logically it should be\\nviewed as inherently dangerous.\"\\n\"1\\nLaBelle argued that \"a feasible alternative design\" did exist that would have\\nenabled Philip Morris U.S.A. to reduce the risks of cigarettes, based on the testimony of\\nWilliam Farone, a former company scientist who has testified in several smoking and\\nhealth cases against Philip Morris U.S.A.\\nHowever, after reviewing Farone's testimony in those cases, Judge Duffy rejected\\nFarone's assertions as unproven speculation.

Reynolds Tobacco will start putting\\nwarning labels on all their cigarette packages, amid mounting criticism over\\nsales of unlabeled smokes in some developing countries.\\nSpokesmen for the companies said Friday they hoped to have health warnings on\\nall of their cigarette packages within a year. Health wartnings have been\\nrequired on cigarettes sold in the United States since the mid-1960s.\\nMarkets where no labels are currently required include the Philippines, the\\nDominican Republic, Lebanon, Morocco and Yugoslavia.\\nThe tobacco companies downplayed the significance of their moves, saying\\nunlabeled cigarettes make up only a small portion of their sales.\\nThe decisions were nonetheless welcomed by a coalition of church groups that\\nhas been pushing for health warnings for more than a decade.\\nPhilip Morris is the biggest U.S. tobacco maker and its brands include\\nMarlboro and Virginia Slims. Reynolds' brands include Winston, Camel and Salem.\\nDiane Bratcher, a spokeswoman for the Interfaith Center on Corporate\\nResponsibility, said labels help people \"make informed decisions when they\\ndecide to smoke.\" She said some smokers in countries where warnings are not\\ncarried may be completely unaware of the health risks.\\nThe policy change at Philip Morris International was disclosed by a Milwaukee\\npriest who said he had been informed that the company would begin putting\\nwarning labels on cigarette packages that do no currently carry them.\\nThe Rev. Michael Crosby, a spokesman for the Midwest Province of the Capuchin\\nOrder, which owns shares in Philip Morris, said the order has been pressing the\\ntobacco company to make the move since 1980.\\n0\\nLEXIS NEXIS LEXIS NEXIS\\n0\\n2500115490",

The law went into effect on\\nJune 30, 1999. All of the 46 states involved in the Master Settlement Agreement of\\nNovember 1998 are required to pass a similar law which seeks to ensure that non-\\nsignatories do not gain an unfair advantage in the marketplace.\\nAs of July 30, 1999, a total of 37 of the 46 states involved in the Master Settlement\\nAgreement have passed similar legislation. Ohio is considered an important state for\\ncigarette manufacturers because it ranks in fourth place in terms of cigarette sales among\\nall fifty states.\\nThe Obio Attorney General's office as well as state tax authorities are investigating the\\nsales volumes of all non-signatories in the state.\\nIt is the opinion of Carolina Tobacco Company, trademark owner and exclusive importer\\nof the \"ROGER\" cigarette brand, that authorities in the state of Ohio and in other states.\\nwill turn their attention to the wholesalers/jobbers who stamp those cigarettes\\nmanufactured by non-signatories when they are unable to obtain escrow finds from the\\nmanufacturers themselves. It is important to remember that the states are obligated to\\nseek these funds from non-signatories, as this was negotiated in the Master Settlement\\nAgreement.\\nJason Office, 5533 S.W.
