Center, North Chicago, IL.\\nDISCOVERIES (chronological):\\n1) Two novel human blood-group active sugars in higher plants. 2) Proof that anti-blood\\ngroup A.B.H(O). Thomsen Friedenreich & In antibodies in man are predominantly elicited by\\nintestinal flora, and, in addition, by antigen (Ag) inhalation & ingestion. 3) Biological, physical\\nand full chemical characterization of a vertebrate lectin. 4) Isolation & characterization of septic\\n(toxic) shock receptors to which microbial toxins attach before eliciting lethal shock. 5)\\nDemonstration of the importance of hydrophobic monosaccharides as specific precipitinogens of\\nanti-H(O) lectin. This contrasts with general belief that, \"lattice formation\" is a precondition for\\nimmunological-serological specific precipitin reactions. 6) 2 patents with CIBÀ-GEIGY. 7)\\nDemonstration of heavy contamination of all commercial influenza virus vaccine with blood group\\nA-like and Forssman Ags (danger in pregnancy). 8) Discovery that one gene can control both\\nblood group Ag- and virus receptor-specificity (including tumor causing viruses) e.g.: (i) human\\nMN epitopes (Eps) & specific myxovirus receptors (Rpt); (ii) infectious mononucleosis Paul-\\nBunnell Ag specific receptor and putative Rpt for the Epstein-Barr tumor virus; (iii) chicken blood\\ngroup R1-isoAg Rpt for Rous Sarcoma and myxoviruses. 9) Characterization of human blood\\ngroup MN-specific Ags & Eps by mild stepwise degradation and biosynthesis. 10) Discovery of\\nhuman T & Tn Ags as: (i) specific pancarcinoma (CA)-markers, (ii) -auto-Ags, (iii) -adhesion,\\n(iv) -motility molecules. T & Ta are not immunoaccessible in discased and healthy tissues, except\\nsome leukemias. 11) Relative and absolute densities of T & Tn on CA cells, permit stratification of\\npatients for adjuvant therapy, post primary surgery. 12) Over 85% of all human CAs elicit yery\\nearly, and throughout strong, readily detectable cellular and humoral anti-CA-T & -Tn immune\\nresponses of high diagnostic (even yrs prior to positive biopsy) and prognostic value, 13)\\nDiscovery that glycolipids may carry Tn, IN & M Eps. 14) Successful active, specific\\nvaccination with \"artificial\" T Ag (ASTI) of breast CA patients Stages III & IV up to >15 yrs.\\nProbability that our combined ASTI results (survival rate) are due to chance: 5 yrs, p < 10-7; 10\\nуīs, p < 10-8 that the survival rates, obtained by use, are due to chance, (p less than 1 in 10\\nmillion in 5 yrs and less than 1 in 100 million persons after 10 yrs). (5 or less in 100 is statistically\\nsignificant) [statistically significant is probability p ≤ 0.05 x 10-²).\\n40008543\\nmore --->",
