Please provide any historical information you\\nmay have.\\nWillie the Penguin started with KOOL when the brand was introduced in\\n1933. He was featured in KOOL magazine and billboard advertising from\\nthe brand's beginning, helping make KOOL an instant success.\\nWillie was a very hot KOOL penguin.\\nHe was on salt and pepper shakers,\\nkey chains and jewelry.

He has\\nbeen unwilling to release his name publicly saying he wants to hold\\ndown mail and offers of marriage.\\nI can say he is an updated, somewhat irreverent version of Willie and\\nis part of one market test to broaden KOOL's appeal with young adult\\nsmokers and update consumer perceptions of the product.\\n690840746",
