Decreased sleep-time response in mice to hexobarbital is used in\\nthis study as a non-specific indicator of hepatic microsomal activity. The\\np-nitroanisole 0-demethylase and aniline nydroxylase activities of isolated\\nrat liver microsomes are used to measure more specific forms of liver\\ninduction.\\nTEST ARTICLE\\nThe test article, 8-146, is a clear liqud, and was received from the\\nsponsor on March 30, 1983. The test article was refrigerated in the\\ncontainers in which it was received. Methylcellulose (1%) was used as the\\nvehicle in this study.\\nAppropriate amounts of 8-146 were mixed with methylcellulose (1%) to\\nachieve the correct dose level. The concentration of B-146 in the mixture was\\nadjusted so that the volume administered was 10 ml/kg body weight. 431\\nmixtures were thoroughly agitated just prior to and continually during dosing.\\nHEXOBARBITAL SLEEP-TIME ASSAY\\nTest Animals\\nFifteen male and fifteen female CD1 albino mice. purchased from Charles\\nRiver Breeding Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, Massachusetts), weighing\\nbetween 23.8-32.2 grams for males and 21.4-23.7 grams for females, were\\nselected for this study. Prior to placement on study, the animals were\\nquarantined for at least seven days and observed daily for appearance and\\nbehavior. The animals were group housed (5/cage) in suspended stainless stee!\\nwire-mesh botton cages. Purina Rodent Laboratory Chow #5001 and water were\\navailable ad libitum.\\nExperimental Design\\nAt the end of the quarantine perice, healthy animals were assigned to the\\nfollowing treatment groups using a computer-generated random number listing:\\n8LI #1505(3)\\n00966516",

Once all these cigarettes\\nare received, they will be submitted for smoke and chemical analyses.\\nControl of Nicotine Delivery\\nPreviously, casing Marlboro filler at a 10% target level with either glucose,\\nfructose or sucrose effected no change in nicotine delivery efficiencies. Recent\\nexperiments indicate that an isosweet casing on a high alkaloid Burley tobacco\\nreduces the nicotine delivery efficiency by about 15%. The next experiment\\nwill follow up on this latest information by casing high alkaloid Burley, DBC\\nBurley and DBC Bright tobaccos at 10% target levels of sugar to determine\\nwhat the effects are on nicotine delivery efficiency.\\nChemical Forms of Nicotine\\nLiterature references (dating 50-60 years ago) have been found relating to\\nthe isolation of \"bound\" forms of nicotine from tobacco. As soon as copies\\nof these references are in hand, work will begin to duplicate the reported results\\nso that the compounds can be isolated and structural determinations made.\\nII.

The part of the regulation relating to\\ntobacco \"stresses that .. the major elements of the strategy for\\ncadmium control should be .. stimulation of research and\\ndevelopment .. of varieties of tobacco.. with a lower cadmium\\ncontent\" (1).\\nAlthough a 1980 government document (2) emphasised the need to\\nkeep cadmium exposure as low as possible, to date, Denmark has been\\nthe EC country spearheading concern over this issue, following\\nSwedish precedent. On 1st January 1984, a regulation (3) came into\\nforce in Denmark prohibiting, the manufacture and importation of\\nproducts containing, cadmium. But this referred only to products in\\nwhich cadmium is used as a surface treatment, colouring pigment or\\nplastic stabiliser making up more than 75 parts per million (ppm) in\\nthe homogeneous components of the product, and there was a list of\\nproducts which could continue to be imported. Nevertheless, the\\nCommission considered that this \"can constitute a significant barrier\\nto intra-Community trade\" (la) and it prompted: Lord Cockfield to\\n.comment (4) that the Danish ban on cadmium was out of step with the\\ngeneral Community approach to the prevention of heavy metal\\npollution. He reported (4) that the Commission would be drawing up a\\nplan of action for an overall reduction of cadmium pollution, of\\nwhich their above regulation is presumably the outcome.\\nAlso in 1980, a report (5) had apparently been prepared for the EC\\nCommission in which cadmium concentrations in tobacco leaf had been\\ncollated. However, this report is proving elusive and the London\\nInformation Office for the EC Commission claims to have no record of\\nit.\\nRecently, the UK Government's Health and Safety Executive published a\\nleaflet (6) stating three ways in which cadmium got into the body.\\nviz \"mainly by breathing in dust or fumes, also by eating foods\\ncontaminated with cadmium dust, and from smoking cigarettes\".\\nThe new California Proposition 65, which came in force on 1st March,\\nincludes cadmium and cadmium compounds under its list of designated\\ncarcinogens for which regulatory warning labels are required if\\nexposure is by ingestion. However, under an exemption caveat, up to\\none microgramme of cadmium per day is considered to present no\\nsignificant risk by routes other than ingestion and thereby requires\\nno warning label (7).\\nThe draft Gulf SASO standard for cigarette specifications currently\\nbeing considered by the industry (which is based on an obsolete 1966\\nIndian standard still being promulgated by WHO) requires that the\\ncadmium content in cigarette tobacco shall not exceed 0.0\\nmicrogrammes per cigarette.\\nContinued\\n2024966076",

In order to evaluate\\npossible differences of the results obtained by normalizing to the 2 types of body weight, the\\nrelative organ weights of those rats dissected on the second day should be calculated by both\\nmethods. Since the number of cais disseried on the second day is relatively low, Fadditionally\\nsuggest an calculate, and compare the relative organ weights of the 21-day SIGMA MS inhalaton\\nstudy by the 2 methods.\\n• Date: 04 Jun-92\\nHJH: Few rats were conspicuous because of their body wright development.

Additional pyrazines were analyzed\\n(McCourt, Howe, Houminer) and added to our data bases.\\nSamples of glycosylamine, galactosylamine and the Amadori compound\\n1-deoxy-prolino-fructose were analyzed for S.

This behavior reflects the relative\\nthermal stabilities of these compounds.\\nThe growth phase of the sucrose tetraester (STE) study was completed\\nwith receipt of the final air-cured burley sample. Analysis of all\\nextracts by DCI should be complete by next month.\\nA paper was presented by W. N.

Haut. The glycosylamine is identical to the product\\nformed by heating glucose and ammonium hydroxide in aqueous solution (2).\\nThe proton NMR spectra of galactosylamine, mannosylamine, and rhamnosylamine\\nconfirm that a single isomer is present (when prepared by heating an\\naqueous solution of the sugar and ammonia) and analysis of the proton-proton\\ncoupling constant data suggest that it is the beta isomer in each case.\\nInitial experiments were conducted where glucose was heated with\\nDAP in aqueous solution. The carbon-13 NMR spectra as a function of\\nheating time show a small buildup of an intermediate (0-10 min at 93°C)\\nwhich decomposes with further heating. During this time, the color of\\nthe solution changes as follows: clear-yellow-orange-brown-black.\\nComparison of the position of the new peaks in the spectra with chemical\\nshifts of reference compounds suggests that the intermediate may be\\ndiglycosylamine.

A wide spectrum of UV radiation is carcinogenic in\\nexperimental animals.\\nSolar radiation has been determined to cause cutaneous malignant melanoma and non-\\nmelanocytic skin cancer in humans, but the relationship of solar radiation to melanoma of the eye\\nis less clear (reviewed in IARC, vol. 55, 1992). Recent case-control studies have found strong\\nsociations of cutaneous malignant melanoma with exposure to sunlamps or sunbeds (Swerdlow\\net al., 1988; Walter et al., 1990; Autier et al., 1994; Westerdahl et al., 1994), especially in\\nindividuals under 30 and those who experience sunburn. Dose-responses for increasing duration\\nof exposure were observed. Malignant melanoma of the eye is also associated with use of\\nsunlamps (reviewed in IARC, vol. 55, 1992). There is little support for an association of\\nsunlamps or sunbeds with nonmelanocytic skin cancer (reviewed in IARC, vol. 55, 1992). There\\nis inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of exposure to fluorescent lighting\\n(reviewed in LARC, vol. 55, 1992).\\nThere is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of solar radiation, broad-spectrum UV\\nradiation, UVA radiation, UVB radiation, and UVC radiation in experimental animals (reviewed in\\n[ARC, vol. 55, 1992). There is clear evidence for benign and malignant skin tumors in mice, rats,\\nhamsters, opossums, and fish, and for tumors of the comea and conjunctiva in rats, mice and\\nhamsters. Solar radiation and nonsolar UV radiation cause mutations or other genetic alterations\\nin a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays for genetic toxicity.\\nRC-1\\n2063601121",

In addition to\\nconventional histopathological examination, routine paraffin sections were\\nimmunohistologically stained for various rat CK and evaluated. Changes in CK expression\\nwere observed in the nonciliated respiratory epithelium of maxilloturbinate, lateral wall, and\\nnasoturbinate: in basal cells, increase of CK14 and CK18 and decrease of CK15; in\\nnonciliated columnar cells, increase of CK15 and CK19. These CK changes had\\nhistomorphological correlates, i.e., reserve-cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia. CK\\nexpression changes were also seen at sites without histomorphological changes, e.g.,\\nenhanced expression of CK14, CK18 in ciliated cells at the dorsal meatus, and CK15 at the\\nseptum Most of the CK expression changes seen after 1 year of RASS exposure resembled\\nthe changes previously seen after 8 days of exposure.\\n2064281754",

    "text": "°\\n○\\n0\\nDose of nicotine:\\n\"\\n•\\n\"Smoking doses\": It has been assumed that nicotine doses typically obtained from\\nsmoking one cigarette would be approx. 0.5 – 2.0 mg or about 7 - 30 µg/kg\\n(Benowitz et al. 1990). Assuming 10 puffs per cigarette, nicotine dose per puff\\nwould be 0.73 µg/kg.\\nCPP in rats: the doses which typically induce CPP in rats are around 0.5 mg/kg\\ns.c., as in the Dewey et al.'s microdiarysis and CPP studies in rats.\\nIntravenous self-administration in rats: SD and Long-Evans rats were reported to\\nself-administer nicotine 30 µg/kg/infusion while Fisher and Lewis rats failed to\\nacquire self-administration at 60 µg/kg/infusion (e.g. Shoaib et al., 1997; with\\npriming injection at the start of the experiment; other reports e.g. Corrigal and\\nCoen 1989 utilized restricted feeding).\\nIntravenous self-administration in rhesus monkeys: 10 µg/kg/infusion has been\\nreported to maintain self-administration response (e.g. Wakasa et al., 1995).\\n\"Threshold dose\" of nicotine to induce DA increase in NAcc: I do not have the\\nimmediate answer for this*. With the current technology, as you mentioned, it\\nwould be unlikely to observe the increase at \"smoking doses\". Frank might have\\nsome reports at hand. At any rate, I would like to keep an open-minded stance on\\nthis issue for we don't know what will come out when we have advanced\\ntechnology.\\n\"This kind of \"problems” will be much improved If I have an easy access to various\\ndatabases, e.g. that of Frank's.\\nHuman drug discrimination: it has been reported that 12 µg/kg nicotine\\nadministered by measured-dose nasal spray was 'reliably discriminated\" (Perkins\\net al., 1994). However, subjective effects of the training dose as measured by\\nstandardized questionnaire do not give much information what kind of subjective\\neffects served as a cue.\\nThus, all the effects described above can be said to be observed at higher doses than\\nthe assumed \"smoking doses\", and in most cases much higher than the \"puffing\\ndoses\". However, I do not think that the animal data utilizing doses higher than the\\nsmoking/puffing doses should be disregarded as irrelevant because of the dose per se,\\nbecause, for example, 1) they are not humans (e.g. receptor sensitivities might be\\ndifferent), and 2) situation is quite different (e.g. effects of nicotine is examined in a\\nvery restricted/controlled situation), and 3) although it makes intuitive sense (to me)\\nthat nicotine may play an important role in human smoking behavior, we do not know\\nto what extent it does. All we can say, I think, is that there are data, which suggest\\nsuch pharmacologic characteristics of nicotine, which may also be applicable to\\nhumans (and smoking behavior).\\nDose of vigabatrin:\\nTo my knowledge, clinical dose is 1.5-2 g/day. However, I do not have the PDR and it\\ncould be 2g twice daily, as stated in Dewey et al. that \"2-4 g/day for epilepsy\" (page 82,\\nline 14). Although I doubt that a bolus dose of 4 g is given as one dose, the doses\\nused may not be \"awfully high\", although in an intravenous self-administration study in\\nmonkeys, vigabətrin at approx. 300-600 mg/kg in a day produced vomiting and/or\\n2070747648",

Box 26583, Richmond, Virginia 23261-6583\\nAbstract\\nTransfer from nicotine (1), various nicotine carboxylic acid salts (2 and 3),\\nand from Burley, Bright and Oriental tobacco samples to nicotine in the gas\\nphase has been examined by thermogravimetric/differential thermal\\nanalysis/mass spectroscopy (TG/DTA/MS) and evolved gas analysis (BGA).\\nUnder the conditions used in these studies, the peak transfer temperatures of\\nthese substances to nicotine in the gas phase are: nicotine and nicotine acetate,\\nboth ca. 110-125°C; nicotine malates, ca. 160-210°C; and nicotine\\nbis(hydrogen-2R 3R)-tartrate), ca. 195-210°C. The peak appearance\\ntemperatures of nicotine in the tobacco samples were observed in a range of\\nca. 160-220ºC. These results suggest that nicotine is mostly in its protonated\\nforms in tobacco leaf. In all cases, the temperature of the transfer of nicotine\\nto the gas phase was found to be many hundreds of degrees below the\\nTemperatures observed around the coal of a burning cigarette (smolder, ca.\\n500-775°C; dynamic smoking, 600 to over 950°C). Within the narrow zone.\\nof a puffing cigarette that encompasses an intermediate temperature range\\n(125-250°C), kinetic data suggest that these temperatures are not sufficient to\\nvolatilize significant amounts of nonprotonated nicotine, assuming any exists\\nat all, during the short pal duration (2 seconds).

C Eucherhofer, J Dickmann, B Gerstenberg. R Stabbert, K. Rustemeier, HJ\\nHaussmann. INBIFO Institut fuer biologische Forschung (a Philip Morris research lab), Cologne,\\nGermany\\nPreventive health policies for humans against potential risks from chemicals are based on risk\\nassessment, which deals with the qualitative classification of substances and/or the quanulative\\ndelineation of risk factors or reference concentrations thereof. To prioritize cigarette smoke\\nconstituents as targets for reduction, we applied the approach outlined in the US EPA\\nguidelines for the comparative assessment of chemical mixtures (1980) and used published\\ninhalation unit risks and reference exposure limits, e.g., Cal EPA (2002), for cancer and non-\\ncancer risk estimates. Smoke constituent yields for the Reference Cigarettes 1R4F and 1R5F\\nas well as 8 market brands were determined and weighted with the cancer and non-cancer risk\\nfactors. With this model, the ranking of calculated risks suggests that the major risk contribution\\ncomes from only a few gas phase constituents, e g., 1.3-butadiene and acrylonitrile for cancer\\nand acrolein for non-cancer. This weighting approach can also be used in the comprehensive\\nassessment of the smoke chemistry of new cigarette designs. In smoke from an electrically\\nheated cigarette with ammonium magnesium phosphate the overwrap, the yields of most\\nsmoke constituents were significantly reduced compared to the 1R4F, while a few were\\nincreased. Application of the weighting approach demonstrated an overall reduction in the\\ncatculated cancer and non-cancer risk estimates for the electrically heated smoking system\\ncompared to the 1R4F. Although this approach is somewhat limited by the uncertainty/lack of\\npotency data and the inherent limitation of the chemical analysis of complex mixtures such as\\ncigarette smoke, it can supplement the evidence obtained from experimental toxicological\\ninvestigations for the overall evaluation of new cigarette designs.\\n2505946475\\nX HMMCOCLINint Collection Nov0ZSmeking Schedules SOT2003_RISH ASSESSMENT 30Sep.occ\\nDRAFT for discussion\\n2004",

The IARC assessment was based on increased risk for nasal\\nadenocarcinoma and other types of nasal cancer in European workers; the risk appeared\\nto be associated primarily with exposure to leather dust. Increased risks were also found\\nfor other sites including urinary bladder cancer and leukemia. Although there is little\\ndocumentation of actual exposures, these risks were ascribed to exposure to benzene and\\nother solvents, dyes, and metallic compounds.\\nStudies conducted in Europe and published since IARC (1981), including a series of\\nstudies based on the Swedish Cancer Environment Registry, have found increased cancer\\nrisks at several tissue sites with little confirmation for any individual site. The studies\\nbased on the Swedish Cancer Environment Registry all involved employment in 1960 or\\nearlier, although employment may have continued beyond that date. Studies of boot and\\nshoe manufacture and repair in the United States have, with one exception, employed\\ndesigns which cannot either confirm or rule out the possibility of increased risk. Walker\\net al. (1993), in a retrospective cohort mortality study of workers employed between\\n1940 and 1979 in two U.S. shoe factories, found an increased risk for cancer of the\\ntrachea, bronchus, and lung (SMR=1.47; 95% CI=1.20-1.80). The risk of lung cancer was\\nreduced, but not eliminated, by indirect adjustment for smoking.\\nEmployment in shoe manufacture and repair has involved exposure to many agents\\nknown or reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens. Some of these agents are no\\nlonger permitted to be used in the U.S. industry. Industrial hygiene data describing actual\\nexposures to these agents are minimal. Assessment of hazards associated with\\nemployment in the U.S. industry is complicated by the fact that changes in both\\n83197397",
