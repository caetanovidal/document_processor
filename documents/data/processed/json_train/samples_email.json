Several years ago I heard Larry Murillo discuss avoiding offending aboriginal people by talking\\nabout being \"against tobacco.\" If you've never visited the website of Traditional Native American Tobacco\\nSeed Bank and Education Program (TNAT) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) --\\nhttp://www.treaty 7.org/friends/that/mat.htm -- please do so or visit any number of other sites involving\\nNA, Health & Tobacco Use. \"All tobacco is an extremely powerful, sacred and dangerous substance. When\\nused properly and with respect, in small amounts in traditional American Indian ceremonies, tobacco is a\\npositive source of power. When misused, especially in the form of cigarettes, snuff. cigars and other\\nconunercial products, tobacco is a deadly killer.\"\\nThe incensed correspondent may not agree with the above statement, but isn't it imperialistic for some of us\\nto try to eridicate someone else's heritage [including tobacco farmers]? At least in VA some of the public\\nhealth community have tried to communicate with growers regarding finding a solution that incorporates\\nmultiple parties.\\nIf anyone wants to flanse me for saying this (as was done earlier regarding my own tobacco use), I would\\nappreciate you sending the e-mail to me directly at fergusou zinav net. Thank you.",

How efficient! Thanks for the slide. Just a couple of questions to ensure that represent the past correctly\\n(I think I know the answers to some of these, but I just want to be sure!)\\n->\\n•\\nI seem to remember Richard saying that there were some written 'guidelines' for ingredient assessment prior\\nto the most recent version. Although I think these were probably more piecemeal in format did they actually\\nspecify the types of toxicology testing which were performed?\\n[Carmines, Edward L.] Yes, but they were more suggestive than specific. Testing Aspects\" wore listed as:\\nChemistry\\nPyrolysis\\nSmoke Chemistry\\n•\\nIn vitro and in vivo Toxicity studies\\n[Caminos, Edward L.] Under the toxicity test heading there was a !lst of studies ranging form acutes and gene\\ntox to carcinogenicity and chronic studies.\\nWas there a minimum battery of tests through which all new ingredients were assessed, or was this also\\nperformed on a case by case basis based on literaturo / structural analysis?\\n[Carmines, Edward L] Testing was judged on a case by case basis and was more driven by our\\nestimates of potential exposure and our knowledge of the toxicity of the material. We didn't use formal\\nstructural activity analysis as a tool to make our decisions, but in reality we are always looking at the\\nstructure and making toxicological judgements. The most recent testing battery included smoke\\nchemistry, ames, cytotox, and inhalation. We are in the process of adding the micronucleus and\\nlymphoma. Both have been approved, but we haven't actually run an ingredient through them yet.\\nAm I correct in thinking that most previous was testing basically Ames and Cytotox, the mouse lymphoma and\\nmicronucleus tests only being added more recently as our experience with these has evolved?\\n[Carmines, Edward L.] Yes\\nDid we do much (if any) inhalation tests for ingredient review in the past?\\n[Carmines, Edward L.) Inhalation tests as well as skin painting tests have been run in the past but were\\nmostly in response to specific Issues or allegations that for Ingredient approval. To date we have\\nessentially completed 3 inhalation studies on ingredients.\\nDid structure-activity analysis also play a significant role in assessment? [Carmines, Edward LJ Not really. For\\nthe most part tox data exits on the GRAS materials and SAR is not necessary\\nWas the expert panel review a one off review of all the ingredients in use at time X or did we ever ask to review\\nIndividual ingredients? Was this for the industry list or for PM alone? [Carmines, Edward L.) The industry expert\\npanel (6 experts) looked at a composite list of all ingredients used by the industry including the maximum use level\\nand made a determination that ingredionts were not harmful under the conditions of use.\\nBy the way, it is not my intention to go into great detail on this, I just want to be fully prepared!\\nOnce again many, many thanks! As you may have gathered I need as much support as I can get!\\n[Carmines, Edward L.) Please feel free to call me if you need additional help.

On\\naverage, sales at the local bars, taverns and pubs have dropped\\nnearly 30 percent since the enactment of the ban. I have talked to\\nliterally thousands of owners and employees who have sales and\\nincome losses as high as 95 percent. Thousands of employees have\\nhad their hours cut, and hundreds have lost their jobs because of the\\nJoss of the smoking customers who form a majority of their\\ncustomer base. (Last year, my establishment suffered its worse.\\nperformance in 15 years).\\nAs for the \"huge influx of non-smoking customers\" who were\\nsupposed to flock to our establishments after the ban -- well, it never\\nhappened. We are attempting to regain our smoking clientele by\\nintroducing a bill that would allow bars and taverns, not restaurants,\\nto permit smoking in designated areas wherein the latest air filtration\\nsystems are in use.\\nContrary to the blatherings of anti-smoking zealots such as Stanton\\nGlantz, banning smoking in adult bars is not popular -- not with the\\nemployees, not with the customers (especially the tourists from other\\nstates) and most certainly not with the bar owners.\\nMARK GORSKI\\nSan Diego\\nRJR1499084578\\n70000 9996\\n52782 6573",

These regions are\\nMWSA, Northern and Southern California, and Seattle.\\nFor all remaining regions, keep the ceiling as is. That is $0.20/$2.00 in all outlets\\nexcept CO's, where the ceiling is $0.30/$3.00.\\nMake this effective in the data for next Saturday's update. I understand it is not\\npossible to rerun the back data to make this effective for the first two weeks in June in\\nthe trended reports currently under development.\\nThe timing on this revision appears to be open.

The 0.5% upper limit specification was based on historical Cardwell\\nTest Method data. A more sensitive Cardwell Stem Test Method has been evaluated\\nwhich gives better definition of stem content. An investigation/review of Historical (over\\ntime) QA capabilities data (CP & CPK data) using the new test method has been\\ncompleted and utilized as a basis for developing % Stem Content upper reject limit.\\nPRODUCT IMPACT: Since no process change is being implemented, there should not\\nbe any negative impact and should provide a higher quality product because of the\\nmore sensitive test method.\\nPRODUCT DISPOSITION: Quip out of spec material and re-run through the process.\\nRISK ASSESSMENT: We do not see any risk associated with the proposal at this\\ntime, in fact, the more sensitive setup of the Cardwell Test Method will provide a more\\nconsistent product.\\nRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended that this specification be accepted by the\\nPAC Committee. This procedure note will be reviewed in light of process capability\\nupon the completion of a 90 day review period.\\nRJR0000000537013366\\n70060 2552\\n53077 4974",

    "text": "February 12. 1997\\nDear Legislator:\\nIf you are thinking about raising your state's cigarette tax, I ask you stop and seriously examine\\nwhat has happened in New York State -- where the state has been trying to deal with Native.\\nAmericans selling illegal contraband cigarettes at an alarming rate.\\nStatistics provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and our state's revenue department\\nillustrate the magnitude of this contraband problem:\\nAnalysis of Official Data\\nReveals Level of Illegal Sales\\nNew York Revenue Department data show that the per capita legal, tax-paid\\nsales of cigarettes in New York is 70.5 packs a year. But studies by the U.S.\\nCenters for Disease Control indicate that per capita consumption in New\\nYork is 97.4 packs, which is just slightly above the national average.\\n70 packs per person “sold\" in N.Y.\\n97 packs actually consumed in N.Y.\\nWhere are the missing packs coming from? Answer: New Yorkers\\npurchase them illegally. The numbers indicate that today, nearly 27 percent\\nof New York's entire cigarette market is contraband - sales that have\\navoided New York State's high cigarette tax.\\nA major source for this illegal, lax-free market in our state is the Indian Reservations. At 56 cents\\nper pack, New York's cigarette tax encourages consumers to buy at Indian smoke shops -- where\\nno cigarette tax is collected and no sales tax is charged. The \"savings\" to consumers is $6.42 a\\ncarton (state cigarette tax, plus sales tax). But the \"loss\" to the state in revenue is enormous\\nestimated to be up to $233 milion a year -- coupled with a huge loss to the state's legal retail\\nindustry.\\nBy law, this shouldn't have happened. The Supreme Court ruled several years ago that New\\nYork State had the authority to regulate Indian sales of cigarettes to non-tribal members. But the\\nregulations have not been enforced. Just today, however, the Governor's office announced that it\\nwould try to reach an agreement with \"traditional\" state tribes and begin enforcement by April 1,\\nRJR0000000508034435\\n70045 2348\\n53097 1275",

    "text": "Proposal: Pilferage Study\\nBackground\\nCumberland Farms, a 800+ retail c-store chain in the northeast, believes that pilferage has\\nincreased. Two factors appear to be driving those increased rates of pilferage. First, a\\nrebounding New England economy has created a higher than usual personnel turnover for\\nCumberland Farms. Secondly, the enforcement by Cumberland Farms of the \"age verification\\nlaw\" has increased pilferage by minors. These conditions, primarily the second appear to be of a\\nlarger concern at store locations with self-service cigarette displays.\\nResearch Question\\nThe overall research issue that is important to Cumberland Farms can be summarized as follows:\\n\"As age verification enforcement by Cumberland Farms has increased, due to new legislation.\\nthe rate of pilferage has increased to unacceptable levels” principally in stores with self-service\\ndisplays. Internal Cumberland Farms audits suggest that the level of pilferage has reached levels\\nthat exceed manufacturer's RDA payments. The questions in this research are: What is the level\\nof pilferage? Is it internal or consumer driven?\\nMethodology\\nThe following methodology is being used to answer the research question(s). A 20 store panel,\\nchosen by Cumberland Farms is being created. Ten of these stores already have cigarettes in a\\nnon-self service place, and the other 10 stores will be matched with displays on a self-service\\nbasis.\\nThe standard audit method will be used to measure pilferage:\\nStep 1:\\nStep 2:\\nStep 3:\\nOpening Inventory\\n+ Deliveries\\n=\\nClosing Inventory\\nMovement\\nMovement\\nSales (Scan)\\nPilferage\\nPilferage\\nMovement\\n=\\n% Pilferage\\nThese results will be compared on a store by store basis and in aggregate to the control stores.\\nA control item of 1% milk will be used as a scan check item. This is to estimate an error rate due\\nto scanning or bookkeeping processes, and this factor will be used to adjust the % pilferage rate.\\nThis methodology will attempt to measure pilferage to the UPC level so that a % pilferage rate\\ncan be created for every style of cigarettes in the category as well as to the brand family level.\\nThis will be helpful, for example, in determining if a brand on display is pilfered at a higher rate\\nthan a brand not on display in a store that maintains self-service displays.\\nRJR0000000417135646\\n70065 9891\\n53171 6126",
