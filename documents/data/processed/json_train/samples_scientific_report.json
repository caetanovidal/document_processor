    "text": "RAISIN CONCENTRATE\\nTERMINOLOGY:\\nRaisin concentrate is the name given to the pure concen-\\ntrated extract of raisins prepared by leaching the raisins with\\nwater. The leaching process is undertaken in several stages to\\nproduce raisin juice. The liquid is then processed in a vacuum\\npan, where the excess water is evaporated to obtain a desired 70°\\nbrix concentration or 70% natural fruit soluble solids.\\nSOURCES:\\nThe major area of production of raisins is California but\\nAustralia and certain areas of the Middle East are also producers.\\nFatty acid esters have been used for many years in Australia and\\nthe Middle East to reduce the drying time of the grapes (1).\\nThis shorter drying time is caused by the interaction of esters\\nin the dip with the waxy surface of the grapes to increase the\\nrate of water loss during drying. In contrast, most California\\nraisins are sun dried without the use of a drying aid, which\\nresults in a raisin with a blue-black color, darker than that of\\nAustralian raisins.\\nRaisin concentrate is manufactured from two different types\\nof raisins, Thompson seedless and Muscats. Each type of concen-\\ntrate has its own distinctive flavor differing chemically in pH\\ndue to the amount of tartaric acid present (2). The range of\\ntartaric acid in the Thompson seedless concentrate is 1.3-2.0%\\ngiving it a pil range of 3.0-3.5. The Muscat concentrate has a\\nconcentration range of 0.7-0.9% tartaric acid with a pH of\\n4.0-4.5.\\nUSAGE:\\nRaisin concentrate is used in the commercial bakery produc-\\ntion of breads as an anti-staling agent, a natural coloring\\nagent, and as a substitute for sucrose, refiners syrup, and\\nmolasses in flavoring and sweetening. The two major sugars found\\nin raisin concentrate are fructose and glucose, found in nearly\\nequal amounts (3). Because raisin concentrate has no sucrose\\ncontent and is a source of natural brown color, it also has\\napplications in the manufacture of natural and healthfood goods.\\nRaisin concentrate is also used as a flavor and humidifying agent\\nfor aromatic tobaccos. It can be found in chewing tobaccos at a\\nlevel of approximately 38 and in cigarettes at 0.25-1.00% of the\\ncasing solutions.\\n03761798",

    "text": "ATTACHMENT A\\nPerformance of Barclay Cigarettes\\nwith Filter Grooves Blocked\\nAn experiment has been performed to determine the variation\\nin ventilation level and smoke delivery of the Barclay cigarette\\nas a function of the number of filter grooves blocked. The\\nBarclay filter relies exclusively on peripheral air channel\\ngrooves to provide a high level of ventilation. It has been\\nshown that the lips of the smoker interact with the filter grooves\\nand thus diminish the ventilation level and increase the \"tar\"\\ndelivered. The present experiment was designed to show the extent\\nof ventilation decrease and \"tar\" increase as a function of filter\\ngroove blockage.\\nBarclay cigarettes (85 mm. soft pack) were prepared by block-\\ning 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the filter groove openings with tipping\\nglue. The glue was carefully applied such that a minimal amount\\nof tow was contacted. After blocking the filter grooves, samples\\nof the prepared cigarettes were submitted to the R&D Analytical\\nServices Division for routine smoke analyses under standard FTC\\nsmoking conditions. Pressure drop and air dilution measurements\\nwere also performed. The results of these analyses are summarized\\nin Table I.\\nAs the results summarized in Table I show, smoke component\\ndeliveries increased dramatically with the number of filter grooves\\nblocked. The FTC \"tar\" delivery increased from 1.8 mg/cigt. with\\nno grooves blocked to 11.7 mg./ cigt. with all four grooves glued\\nshut. Other measured smoke component deliveries as well as ciga-\\nrette drafts (DHO) increased as well. Air dilution levels\\ndecreased from 67.0% with no grooves blocked to 11.9% with four\\ngrooves blocked (Table I). FTC \"tar.\" carbon monoxide (CO),\\ncigarette draft (DHO) and air dilution were found to vary exponen-\\ntially with the number of filter grooves blocked (figures 1, 2, 3,\\n4, respectively). Linear regression coefficients for these models\\nare summarized in Table II.\\nThe results of the experiment show that as the Barclay filter\\ngrooves are closed off, the level of ventilation decreases sub-\\nstantially. As a consequence, FTC \"tar\" and other smoke component\\n(1.g. nicotine, CO, etc.) deliveries increase exponentially. The\\nmathematical models for the relationships between groove blockage\\nand analytical measurements can be used to estimate the number of\\nfilter grooves closed during human smoking of the Barclay. In a\\nsubmission to the FTC, Philip Morris reported that the average\\nventilation level measured for smokers was about 32%*.

It had no\\napparent problems with any of the files referenced. The created\\ndatabase and profile were brought to the Library. The necessary\\nenvironment variables and path names were added to the logins to access\\nfultext.

It was determined that the Pylantir\\nscanner could not be used to enter into the system data that wa3\\ngenerated before January of this year. Prior to this time the method of\\nstoring data was an unconcernedly cut and paste process that created\\nshadows, lines and severe skewing of the file making it impossible for\\nany scanner to read. However, due to improvements in this method used\\nto store data, the Palantir scanner will be used from this date on to\\nscan data into the system.\\nPlans: To remain accessible to the library users as they continue to\\ntest the Fulcrum database to answer questions or give support in anyway\\nneeded.

Initial results\\nsuggest that solutions behave as a pseudoplastic material. Test\\nresults will be used to aid in die design and to establish initial\\nextrusion conditions.\\nII. ADHESIVE APPLICATION\\nThe Findley adhesive foamer was used to provide 50% foamed\\nadhesive for evaluation on the PA-8. Test results indicated large\\nbubble-size formation. Examination of the foamer led to several\\nmodifications and repairs to generate the correct foam consistency.\\nTesting is being performed to establish taste and odor acceptance\\nand actual adhesive usage.\\nIII. CAM III\\nVarious filter samples have been produced for Manufacturing\\nEngineering. Samples have been used to test equipment and evaluate\\nvarious filter designs.\\nSeveral encapsulated flavors have been obtained from suppliers\\nto study flavor release potential. Efforts have been directed at\\ndetermining which encapsulating material (sucrose, malto-dextrin,\\netc.) is most susceptible to the moisture in the filter during smoking.\\nTesting has shown that sufficient water is present to dissolve the\\nencapsulating material.\\n2022180152",

Geiszler\\nJune, 1976\\nDark brown wrapper cigarettes have been made using\\nhumic acid. The CO delivery of these 120 mm models is in the\\n21-24 mg range. These cigarettes will be tested against com-\\nparable models employing Schweitzer's brown Malaucène paper. \"\\nInvestigations into the chemical properties of humic\\nacid are continuing. As a result of extraction studies, sepa.\\nration of the humic acid constituents Fulvic Acid (acid and\\nbase soluble fractions) and Humin (acid and base insoluble\\nfractions) from true humic acid, is being attempted through\\nexhaustive washing at controlled pH. Both Fulvic acid and\\nHumin sodium salts are suspected causes of high CO delivery\\nfrom brown coated papers. 2 Another method of reducing CO\\ndelivery, by washing sodium from the paper, has shown signifi-\\ncant reductions on hand made cigarettes. A continuous washing\\nprocess is being developed so that machine made cigarettes can\\nbe constructed.\\nAl2(SO4)3 has been compared with CaCl2 and MgSO4 as\\na salt post-treatment on brown wrapper cigarettes. All samples\\ngave higher CO deliveries than the untreated control (an arti-\\nfact of the relatively lower deliveries of the present brown\\nwrapper cigarettes). Al2(SO4)3 gave higher CO deliveries than\\nMgSO4 or CaCl2.\\nWork continues on ammonium salts applied to cigarette\\nwrappers. Most of these salts yield a black ash. Calcium phos.\\nphate gives similar puff counts to ammonium phosphate, as well\\nas good ash appearance.\\nSamples of ashless papers have been requested from\\nSchweitzer. These papers will be tested for gas phase deliveries.\\nII.\\nMENTHOL CIGARETTES\\nMenthol applied to package foil has given some interest-\\ning results in terms of migration rate and transfer to smoke.\\nWithin a week, 85% of the menthol moved from the foil to the\\ncigarettes. And over 20% of the menthol in the cigarettes was\\ndelivered to smoke versus 12-14% for a conventional menthol ciga-\\nrette. The cigarettes are now undergoing aging studies, as\\nare diluted menthol cigarettes.\\n2022187982",

The\\nmethod involves the treatment of a portion of the tobacco feedstock (20-40 percent)\\nwith DAP/NH OH as per RCB followed by an acidification step prior to adding the\\nbinder with the balance of the tobacco feedstock to form a combined slurry for\\ncasting.\\nSeveral SIVA formulations were made in the Cast Leaf Lab in an attempt to match\\nthe RLB/RLTC (50/50) subjectives for TSA. The subjective screening of these\\nformulations is currently in progress by Flavor Technology personnel with handmade\\ncigarettes. Attempis to improve the SIVA sheet physicals by increasing the guar\\nbinder level from 4 to 6 parts in the formulation containing a 50/50 mixture of 120\\nand 400 mesh size TSA feedstock were not successful.. This tobacco blend was\\nfound to require 10 parts guar to produce a very good sheet, free of cracks. The\\nproblems may be due to the tobacco particle size distribution in the blend. This\\nproblem is currently being investigated.\\nOther binder systems currently under investigation are locust bean gum and starch.\\nC.\\nPlanst\\n1.

    "text": "Finger Coverage Study\\nMost American filter cigarettes are designed to reduce tar delivery\\nby allowing air to enter the mainstream of smoke through bands of holes\\npierced in the paper covering the filter.

Chory and oben\\nDepartment of Statistics, University of Waterloo\\nHaterloo, Ontario, Cond\\nThis paper describos studies carried out at the University of\\nWaterloo, Ontario, Canada in conjunction with the Smoking and Health Progrom\\nof the Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare. It represents\\nonly one of numerous programs on Smoking and Health supported by the Canadian\\nGovernment. There are three couponents to the work at Waterloo; first, the\\nsurveillance of tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes sold in Canada; second,\\nan investigation of the intake of harmful substances present in tobacco smolte\\nand third, various statistical studico related to smoking habits, Most of the\\ninvestigations described voro carried out under the supervision of Dr. V.S,\\nRickert, Dr. J.C. Robinson and the authors.\\nI. THE SURVEILLANCE OF TAR AND NICOTINE LEVELS IN CANADIAN CIGARETTES\\nTho ain of the surveillanco studies is to provide tho Cenadian\\nsucker with readily accessible information about tar and nicotine levels in\\ncigarettes. In addition, the studios appear to have had sono influence on\\nthe Industry, in that sone Canedian cigarettes now have lower tor and nicotine\\nlevole than before the surveillanco studies began, and these of garottes,\\nthorofore, can be expected to be less horaful. In addition, the results have\\nconfirmed both that it is practicable for the Industry to produce cigrettes\\nwithin a wide range of tar and nicotine delivery count, also, that the ter end\\nnicotino levels of individual brands can be controlled within norrow Mnits.\\nThe survoillance is cerried out bi-annually and the regulta are\\npublished by the Department of National Health and Welfare. Cigarettes are\\ncollected from retailers across Canudo, to ensure that negaurements reflect\\ntho tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes no retually evaileblo to tho\\nconsumer.\\nThe methodology employed for determining tor and nicotine levola\\nis basically that described by Ogg (1). However, the bar data were determined\\nand published (2) as not rather than dry tor. It has also been shown (2) that\\nthere are no significant differences between tar and nicotine contents of\\ncigarettes sold under one brand name to different parts of the country. Con-\\nocquently, for oach brand, cigaretten sold appear to be similar throughout\\nCanada,\\n2024987437\\nDiscussions have also taken place in Canada with a view to arriving\\nat appropriate legislation, which would lead to leas harnful cigaretten.\\nSpecifically, proposed legislation includes specifying permitted apper linits",

PAGES\\nOn Cancer Prevention Study II\\non\\nAMERICAN\\nCANCER\\nSOCIETY*\\nCancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study began in\\nSeptember 1982 when 77,000 volunteers in every state, the District\\nof Columbia and Puerto Rico enrolled 1,200,000 persons in a long-\\nterm prospective study. The participants completed a four-page con-\\nfidential questionnaire\\nhabits, exposures, history of diseases, &\\netc. The plan was to have the volunteers report each year on the\\nvital status of each of the persons enrolled. For those reported\\ndead, death certificates are obtained from state health departments,\\nand analysis be cause of death made in relation to the replies on\\nthe questionnaire.\\n*The first follow-up began in September 1984 and is virtually complete.\\nThose Divisions of the Society that have completed their work have\\ntraced more than 99% of the persons enrolled.\\n* percent\\nEven before deaths were reported we were able to make some analysis\\nin relation to smoking. Smoking habits, among the subjects in the\\nstudy were compared to those of persons similar in age and socio-\\neconomic status who were enrolled in our first prospective study, é\\nCPS I in 1959. Massive changes were apparent. In CPS II, forty.\\nof the men had quit cigarette smoking, more than twice the\\nproportion who reported they had quit in the earlier study (seventeen\\npercent). Only twenty-six percent of men were still smoking. Among\\nwomen, fewer had never smoked (fifty-six percent versus sixty-seven\\npercent) but fewer were current smokers (twenty-one percent versus\\ntwenty-seven percent) and nearly four times as many had quit smoking\\n(twenty-two percent versus six percent). Further analysis shows\\ntremendous shifts on smoking toward lower tar/nicotine cigarettes.\\nSixty-six percent of men and seventy-nine percent of women reported\\nthey smoked cigarettes with <16 mg. tar. Men and women who smoked very\\nlow/tar cigarettes tended to smoke more heavily but not enough to\\ncompensate for the difference in tar content. We found no evidence,\\nas is sometimes alleged, that low/tar nicotine cigarette smokers\\ntend to inhale more deeply than those who smoke higher yield cigar-\\nettes.\\nIt is difficult in most epidemiological studies of diet to relate\\nsingle food items to cancer mortality rates. The Cancer Prevention\\nStudy II questionnaire asks for consumption per week of twenty-eight\\ndifferent specific foods items, such as beef, pork, green leafy\\nvegetables, etc. We did a correlational analysis оп these answers\\nand found that they group\\ninto seven major categories: Vitamin-rich\\nfoods (vegetables, fruits, etc.); High-fat meats and eggs; Desserts;\\nBreakfast foods (oatmeal, cold cereals, bran muffins, etc.); High-\\nprotein-low fat meats (fish, chicken, etc.); Carbohydrates (white\\nbread, rolls, potatoes, etc.); and butter and margarine.\\nWe found that some of these were highly correlated with other factors.\\nThose who scored high in the vitamin-rich category tended to be better\\neducated, and also showed a negative relation to cigarette smoking.\\nOn the other hand, persons scoring high оп the high-fat meat and\\neggs category were more poorly educated and tended to be cigarette\\nsmokers. This points out the need to control carefully on smoking\\nhabit and education when analyzing diet in relation to cancer.",

    "text": "RESEARCH PROPOSAL\\nTitle of Project:\\n1\\nABSTRACT\\nDetermination of Personal Exposures to Environmental Tobacco\\nSmoke on Mainland Europe.\\nWe propose to investigate typical personal exposures to Environmental Tobacco Smoke,\\nETS, in non-smokers across Europe. A variety of inter-related measurements will be\\nmade. In the ETS particle phase they will be respirable suspended particulates (RSP).\\nUV absorbing particulate matter, fluorescing particulate matter and Solanesol, a tobacco\\nspecific marker. In the ETS vapour phase nicotine and 3-ethenyl-pyridine will be\\nmeasured. Corinine levels will be established by analysis of saliva. Questionnaires\\ninvolving some lifestyle information will be included. The main reason for these\\ninvestigations is to determine the level and range of exposure to ETS in a number of\\neuropean cities. The results of this work will contribute significant new data on ETS\\nexposure in Europe.\\nBy providing key comparative indices the resulting data base will contribute to a more\\ncomplete interpretation of a variety of studies, such as those conducted by the\\nInternational Agency for Research into Cancer, LARC.\\nThe intention is to compare and contrast ETS exposure in each country and assess the\\nmagnitude of this exposure in the workplace at home and in total,\\nAlso other airborne contaminants will be measured such as nitrogen, sulphur oxides\\nparticulates, and CO in the vicinity of the homes of 25 volunteers in each of the cities.\\nThese will be stationary monitors.\\nThe study would use 240 randomly selected non-smokers. Each subject would be\\ninvestigated for ETS exposure over a 24 hour period. Separately, but in the same time\\nframe a misclassification sady will also be conducted in each country The studies will\\nbe performed using 200 subjects who will be questioned and have their saliva cotinine\\nlevels measured. This study will establish a misclassification rate by country for smokers\\nwho claim they are non-smokers and vice-versa.\\n2\\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\\nа To determine in non-smoking Europeans, in each city, the range and median\\nlevels of 24 hour exposure to nicotine and to ETS related particulates.\\nb To compare and contrast the levels of ETS exposure in each city.\\nC\\nTo assess the magnitude of exposure in the workplace, the home and in total.\\nd To establish misclassification rates for each city.\\nI\\n2028381373",

The results were reported on a regular basis to be incorporated\\nby PMR in the overall program data base. S-(-) Nicotine or S,R-(+)-nicotine [?] as\\nbitartrate or free base was used as a reference substance or internal standard.\\nAltogether 14 assays were used for testing nicotine analogs. Some of the assays were\\nstandard pharmacological assays (e.g. guinea pig ileum), which were already fully\\nestablished at INBIFO at the beginning of the program, others had to be established or\\nrefined during its course (e.g. rat vas deferens), and others proved to be unsuitable (e.g.\\nfrog posture) during the course of the program. Therefore most compounds were\\ninvestigated in some but not all assays. Another restriction in the application of the assay\\nbattery was the limited amount of test substance available.\\nIsolated investigations with nicotine as a reference substance (e.g. LD50/ED50\\ndeterminations after adminitration by other routes than intravenously or in other mouse\\nstrains) were performed to establish, optimize or better understand assays and their results.\\nFor the same reason a series of other reference substances were investigated in some of\\nthe screening assays.\\nDuring the course of the 9 years of testing at INBIFO, mainly 5 study directors were\\nresponsible for the assays (Table 1);\\n1.

These tables were\\nderived on the assumption that the observed number of mutations is a Poisson\\nvariable. More often than not, however, the reported number of mutations is, in\\nfact, the sum of mutations observed in several replications of the same\\nexperiment. Such replication introduces additional variation (overdispersion),\\nthat is not accounted for if only the aggregate is considered in the analysis. This\\nfailure to account for such overdispersion affects the statistical analyses employed\\nto determine the significance levels of differences between groups or\\nexperimental treatments. In particular, such deviations from the Poisson, together\\nwith the use of Poisson-based statistical tests can lead to an excess of \"false\\npositive\" results. The ultimate objective of our CIAR-sponsored research is to\\nprovide a correction for the overdispersion in Poisson-based statistical tests,\\nthereby reducing the Type I error rates.\\nIn pursuing this objective, we sought to characterize data sets by mathematical\\nmodels that are more realistic than those generally encountered in the research\\nliterature. That is to say, we eschewed the simplistic assumptions of Poisson and\\nbinomial distributions in favor of \"models\" that might better characterize the\\nobserved data. Some of these \"models\" the negative-binomial and the beta-\\nbinomial are well-known to statisticians, and are often used by them. Yet, only\\nrarely, if ever, are they to be found in the literature of practitioner-biologist.\\nOthers, such as the Pearson-type distributions, have been in the statistics literature\\ni\\n||\\n│",

    "text": "25 JANUARY 1986-\\nMONTHLY SUMMARY\\n34 FEBRUARY 1966\\nFOR: David Douglas\\n1. Non-burning smoking article:\\nAdditional work on this subject was done this month by examining the\\nfiltration effect of a cellulose acetate fiiter versus no filter.\\nsample examined was an IFF tobacco neutral fraction flavor. Fifty\\nmicroliters of the sample were applied to a piece of filter paper inside a\\nplastic tube like those used by Flavor Development for the non-burning\\nsmoking article Thirty-five ml puffs were withdrawn alternately at one end\\ncontaining a CA filter and at the other end, which was open. The results of\\nchromatograms produced by samples taken in these ways showed that the later,\\nmore polar, less volatile components are reduced disproportionately when\\npuffed through the CA filter compared to a sample taken with no filter.\\nThis observation could have implications for the use of tobacco-identical\\nflavors in both burning and non-burning smoking products, since this flavor\\nis apparently natural and therefore representative of tobacco-identical\\nflavors.\\nNo additional work is anticipated in this area unless it is desired\\nby supervisors of the Chemical Research Division, as an aid to Divisional\\ngoals or major R&D programs. However, a meno summarizing the observations\\nmade to date is being written.\\n2. Setup of an electron capture detector:\\ndone.\\nSome additional work with the ECD (discussed last month) was\\nmostly to document the work on the PI data system. However in the course of\\nthis work the lower limits of detectability of Lindane and Aldrin were\\nexplored and more difinitively determined. It was found that approximately\\n300-400 femtograms (10-13 grams) of either pesticide could be detected at a\\n2:1 signal to noise ratio, but about half this amount could not. A minimum\\nof 15 picograms of each of the pesticides were detected in 3 microliters of\\na bright tobacco extract. The accuracy of the concentration of the\\npesticide standard being used was compared with a completely separate\\nstandard of Lindane, and the amounts from each source were found to be\\nequal within normal experimental variability.\\nA memo concerning this work is being written, and no further work\\nwill be done in this area unless a need arises.\\n2051028324",

    "text": "OBJECTIVE\\nM/C Burley Dryer #4\\nDouble Rate-Subjective Qualification Test Plan.\\nDetermine subjective qualification of operating the new burley dryer 4 at\\ndouble flow rate.\\nBACKGROUND\\nReplacement of the three remaining burley dryers at the M/C will require an\\n8 week period down time for each dryer. To maintain production capacity\\nwithout incurring significant overtime operating charges, running the new\\ndryer at double production rate would allow full line production capacity\\nto be achieved. Marlboro rate is the basis for speed up and subjective\\nqualification.\\nThe new burley dryer #4 was subjectively qualified and approved for\\nproduction on September 16, 1991. The new dryer has larger drying and\\nreordering sections that has decreased temperatures needed to reach drying\\ntargets at normal production. We feel the new dryer has capacity to\\noperate acceptably at double rate production.\\nTesting in August 1990 confirmed that the old Burley dryer #3 is not capable\\nof operating acceptably at double rate. Only for short periods of time\\ncould we achieve target drying moisture. We were limited in drying area\\nand steam capacity. From this testing, however, we did determine that a\\n50% increase in apron speed through the dryer with double flowrate has the\\ngreatest chance of subjective acceptance. The new Burley dryer #4 has both\\ngreater drying area and steam capacity than the old dryers.\\nSTRATEGY\\nThe test is designed to dry and reorder Burley tobacco to target\\nspecifications at double production flow rate. Higher rates will be\\nachieved by increasing the belt speed through the dryer and increasing\\ndrying zone temperatures. From previous testing on the old burley dryer\\n#3, we feel that increasing the main apron speed by 50%, thus, increasing\\nthe carpet depth has the greatest chance of subjective acceptance. This\\ncondition would require lower drying temperatures than a full 100% increase\\nin apron speed. A control run will be made at normal production operating\\nconditions with both dryers #3 and #4 running. In addition, 250 pounds of\\nburley from the dryers will be collected to produce 100% burley cigarettes\\nat the R&D Semi-works.\\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\\nThe blended Burley\\nBurley strip is blended and stored in the Burley silos.\\nstrip is discharged from these silos and fed at a controlled rate to the\\nBurley spray cylinders. Steam and flavor are applied to the strip in this\\ncylinder. The flavored strip is spread by a wig-wag to the apron feeder on\\nthe burley dryers to distribute flow to the dryer. In the burley dryer\\nthere are three drying zones, a cooling zone and two reordering zones.\\nCV and reordered\\nTypically for Mariboro blends, the burley is dried to 16%\\nto 20% OV. The flavored, dried and reordered strip is conveyed to the\\n2051645686",

    "text": "TOBACCO SMOKE-INDUCED ALTERATIONS OF CYTOKERATIN EXPRESSION IN THE RAT NASAL\\nCAVITY FOLLOWING CHRONIC INHALATION OF ROOM-AGED SIDESTREAM SMOKE\\nSchlage, W.K.', Baltos, H., Friedrichs, D., Kuhn, M., Teredesai, A. 1, Terpstra, P.²;\\n'INBIFO Institut für biologische Forschung GmbH, Fuggerstr. 3, Köln, Germany;\\n*CRC Contract Research Center, Zaventem, Belgium Supported by Philip Morris USA\\nEnvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is a highly diluted mixture of sidestream smoke\\nand exhaled mainstream smoke. It undergoes chemical and physical changes in\\ncomposition due to aging, e.g., by contact with various surfaces over time [1]. In a\\nchronic (12 month) inhalation study on rats using room-aged sidestream smoke\\n(RASS) as an experimental surrogate for ETS, we investigated differentiation\\nchanges, I.e., altered cytokeratin (CK) expression, In the epithelial lining of the res-\\npiratory tract, and the correlation of such changes with classical histopathological\\nfindings. The dose was 12 µg TPM / 1 for 6 h / d (upper limits of typical ETS\\nconcentrations are up to 100-fold lower). We recently developed an immunohisto-\\nchemical method to investigate complex CK expression patterns in routine paraffin\\nsections from rat respiratory tract tissues using a panel of monoclonal antibodies\\nwith defined specificity for rat CK [2]. Using this technique, we could detect CK\\nexpression changes at various sites of the rat respiratory tract that occurred after 8\\ndays of exposure to the same daily dose of RASS [3].\\nThe histopathological findings seen after 12 months of exposure were similar in\\nquality and severity to those seen after 8 days of exposure, l.e., reserve-cell hyper-\\nplasia and squamous metaplasia of the nonciliated respiratory epithelium of maxillo-\\nturbinate, lateral wall, and nasoturbinate at nasal cavity level 1(NL1) (levels acc. to\\n[4]). No findings were observed at level 2 (NL2). Changes in CK expression were ob-\\nserved at the sites where histopathological findings were seen, e.g., enhanced ex-\\npression of CK14 in basal and nonciliated cells at NL1. Additionally, CK expression\\nchanges were seen at sites of NL1 and NL2 where there were no histopathological\\nfindings, e.g., enhanced expression of CK14 in basal cells of the respiratory epithe-\\nlium and in submucosal glands and gland ducts at the septal region of NL2. In our\\npresentation, detailed results obtained for 8 different CK antibodies following 12\\nmonths of exposure will be given and compared to the results obtained for 8 days of\\nexposure.\\nReferences: [1] Voncken, P. et al. in: Dungworth, D.L. et al.

    "text": "REVIEW OF THE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITTI EIGHT IMPURITIES\\nIntroduction\\nEight substances were found to be present in triacetin-based plasticizer (PZ) used in the\\nproduction of cigarette filters (Table 1). Because these substances are focated in the filter and subject\\nonly to slight elevations in temperature from the passage of cigarette smoke, there is no pyrolysis of\\nthese substances. Therefore, this review focuses on the toxicity of the native substances and their\\nmetabolites in comparison to other substances and possible other sources of these substances in\\nnature.\\nOn the basis of their metabolism and toxicity, these substances can be divided into three\\ngroups: (1) a relatively homologous series of six diacetate esters on skeletons of one to four carbons;\\n(2) 2-ethyl-1-hexyl acetate and; (3) butyric acid.\\nRelevant to the discussion of these substances is the notion of exposure. As may be seen in\\nTable 1, the impurities were shown to be in the nanogram range (per cigarette). At a presumed\\nconsumption of 20 cigarettes per day and assuming 100% ingestion of the impurities, none of the\\nimpurities would exceed a total of 2.6 µg/day.\\nExposure\\nPZ from the bulk storage tank and blending tanks were analyzed. The values from the bulk\\nstorage tank were generally higher than PZ from the blending tank and, with the exception of 1,3..\\npropanediol diacetate, the value for each impurity was higher than for a reference sample with no\\nodor problem. The probable exposure to the impurities was derived by calculating from the\\nconcentration of each impurity in the PZ, assuming 0.087 grams of PZ are applied to each gram of\\n✅Table 1.

Some authors\\nhave labeled this increase in prevalence an asthma epidemic. The fact that\\nthe timing of this increase corresponds exactly with a concurrent decline in\\nsmoking as well as a rapid growth of public smoking restrictions in those\\nsame countries indicates that asthma has been increasing while exposure to\\nenvironmental tobacco some (ETS) has been sharply decreasing. This\\ninverse correlation strongly suggests that public health officials and\\nresearchers who are concerned with the current asthma situation in\\nindustrialized countries should focus their attention on exposuros unrelated to\\nETS.\\nAdult Asthma\\nIt is Quite Unlikely that ETS Could Cause Asthma\\nAsthma is a multi-factorial condition characterized by airway hyper\\nresponsiveness which in most cases (75-85%) is caused by any one of\\na number of external immunogenic (allergenic) substances. This\\ndefinition, however, is operational in naturo, and there is no clear cut\\nor agreed upon medical definition of asthma. It should be particularly\\nstressed that not all clinical presentations of airway hyper reactivity\\ncan be classified as asthma. Some well documented examples of\\nimmunogenic substances which have been implicated as a cause of\\nasthma are animal dander, insects, and pollen. Repeated research\\nhas shown that tobacco smoke is not Immunogenic, and, therefore, it\\nis quite unlikely that tobacco smoke can cause asthma.\\nETS and the Exacerbation of Asthma\\nA number of exposure studies - wherein asthmatics have been\\nexposed to generally unrealistically high levels of ETS - have given\\ninconsistent results. Even asthmatics claiming to be \"sensitive to\\ntobacco smoke\" have often not responded to these high levels of ETS\\nin such studies.\\nThe variability of results obtained in studies of acute ETS (or\\nsidestream smoke) exposure on asthmatics is unexplained. This is\\nparticularly illustrated by the fact that some of the studies involving the\\nmost intense end prolonged exposure to ETS failed to evoke a\\nresponse.\\n2065391161",

Avoca Division, Merry Hill, NC, 27957; and Jeff S. Gentry\\nand Timothy B. Nestor, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Winston-Salem, NC,\\n27102.\\nSummary\\nNitrosation of naturally occurring tobacco alkaloids is commonly accepted as the\\nmechanism of tobacco specific nitrosamine (TSNA) formation in tobacco. As\\nminimal-to-no TSNA are present in green tobacco, TSNA formation and\\naccumulation are generally considered to occur during curing. Most recent\\nhypotheses focus on microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrite and other oxides of\\nnitrogen (NO, compounds) that react with tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA during\\ncuring. This natural microbial process remains the prevalent hypothesis for\\nTSNA formation in cured burley tobacco. However, a second mechanism for the\\nformation of TSNA, independent of microbial activity, is presented in this work on\\nflue-cured tobacco.\\nIt is common practice to flue-cure Virginia or blonde tobacco in bulk bams that\\nincorporate forced air ventilation and temperature control. Modern bulk bams\\ngenerally use liquid propane gas (LPG) with direct-fired burners that exhaust\\ncombustion gases directly into the barn where the tobacco is exposed to those\\ncombustion gases. Our studies indicate that LPG combustion by-products,\\nnamely NO, (in the exhaust stream of direct-fired, flue-cured barns) react with\\nnaturally occurring tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA. Heat exchange curing\\nmethods preclude exposure of the curing tobacco to combustion gases and by-\\nproducts, thereby eliminating this significant source of TSNA formation, without\\ndegrading leaf quality or smoking character. Research findings from 1998 and\\n1999 will be presented to demonstrate the significance of direct-fired curing as a\\nsource of TSNA formation in flue-cured tobacco.\\nIntroduction\\nFor decades, nitrosamines have been a focus of considerable research for\\nwhence references abound in the scientific literature. The presence of\\nnitrosamines in cigarette smoke and their possible role in tobacco\\ncarcinogenesis were first postulated in the scientific literature in 1962.1\\nExtensive research by many investigators since the 1970's reported the\\npresence of as many as thirty-five (35) nitrosamines in cigarette smoke.

Griffiths\\nSubmitted to:\\nPhilip Morris USA\\nAttention:\\nDr. Kenneth II Shafer\\nProject Description\\nA. Introduction\\nThe research group of Peter Griffiths, Professor of Chemistry at the University of\\nIdaho, has worked extensively in many areas of vibration spectroscopy over the past 25\\nyears. This group proposes to develop several approaches to test the feasibility of\\ninvestigating how certain selive components of cigarette smoke, namely formaldehyde,\\nacetaldehyde and acrolein, interact with aminopropylsilyl (APS) groups that have been\\nbonded to the surface of silica from both a mechanistic and kinetic viewpoint.\\nB. Mechaniste studies\\nIn the first year of this project, three complementary approaches will be\\ninvestigated to probe the way in which APS groups are ordered when bonded to the\\nsurface of silica. First, we will study the feasibility of activating the surface of a flat\\nmulti-reflection silicon internal reflection element (IRE) by oxidation and hydration of \"\\nthe surface silicon atoms and measuring the attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectrum to\\nprobe the orientation of the APS groups. APS groups will be bonded to the surface\\nsilanol groups by a reaction of the type:\\nSIOH + CISI(CH₁);(CH₂);NH₂ → SIOSi(CH2),NH₂ + HCl\\n2075879017\\npokrized?\\ndepth of pentructi\\nIf the amino groups bond to formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, farge changes in\\nthe spectrum in the region of the NH stretching modes (-3350 cm³) would be forecast.\\nMore subtle changes in the spectra of the APS groups on the surface may also be used as\\na probe for the presence of physisorbed aldehydes. For example, if the APS groups are\\nbonded in an ordered fashion, the frequency of the symmetric and antisymmetric\\nstretching vibrations of the methylene groups should be expected to correspond to those\\nof solid alkanes. If the degree of ordering is reduced on adsorption of another molecule,\\nthe bands will shift to slightly lower wavenumber, more similar to the band centers of the\\ncorresponding bands in the spectrum of liquid alkanes Accurate values for the band\\nshifts would be determined using the center-of-gravity algorithm (i\\n[i].\\nSpecfut\\n\"atff?\"\\n1580ant\\n???\\nLessthabe\\n(only apply a monologr\\nprone to stacked\\nStrictures\\n1",

Paine, III\\nPhilip Morris. P. O. Box 26583. Richmond, Virginia 23261\\nNicotine is the principal alkaloid in tobacco. In theory, this well known and\\nextremely well studied substance can exist in either its nonprotonated (sometimes\\nreferred to as \"nicotine base\") or protonated (sometimes referred to as \"bound nicotine”)\\nforms in cigaretle tobaccos. In the paper to be presented at the 216\" ACS National\\nMeeting in Boston, Massachusetts on August 23, 1998, strong experimental evidence will\\nbe presented which indicates; 1) that nicotine is present primarily in its protonated\\nChound\") forms in tobacco and 2) that nonprotonated nicotine and protonated (\"hound\"?)\\nnicotines are likely to transfer nicotine to smoke with comparable yields and efficiencies\\nduring the smoking process. Since the model systems of \"bound nicotines\" used in this\\nstudy efficienały transfer nicotine to the gaseous/vapor state upon heat treatment, this\\nfurther indicates that \"bound nicotine\" is not bound under the conditions formed around\\nthe coal of a burning cigarette.\\nIn a first set of experiments, sampies of nonprotonated and protonated (^\"bound\")\\nnicotines were heated and analyzed by monitoring weight loss, due to the evolution of\\ngases and vapors, by a technique called thermogravimetry. Simultaneously, the chemical\\nnature of the evolved gases and vapers, was monitored using mass spectroscopy. This\\ncomplement of techniques allows the comparison of the evolution temperatures of\\nnicotine from samples of the nonprotonated and protonated (\"bound\") nicoúnes as well as\\nfrom tobacco samples. Under the conditions used in this study: 1) nonprotonated nicotine\\nevaporates at a peak temperature of about 190°C to 125°C and 2) the peak evolution.\\ntemperatures of nicotine from the various protonated (\"bound\") nicotines are with the\\nrange of 160°C to 220°C. Regarding the form of nicotine in tobacco, experinicals on\\ntobacco leaf constituents (Bright. Burley and Oriental tobaccos) show nicotine transfer to\\n2078569516",

Wu**\\nGuangzhou Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis, Guangzhou Medical College.\\nGuangzhou,China\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College.\\nValhalla, New York, USA\\nIntroduction\\nBenzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant generated by combustion of\\nsubstances such as coal, tobacco and other organic chemicals. Possible human exposure occurs through\\na number of routes including inhalation of polluted atmospheres and cigarette smoke. Epidemiological\\nstudies have shown a close relationship between human lung cancer and exposure to B(a)P(1). B(a)P is\\na procarcinogen that requires metabolic activation to exert its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects(2,3).\\nThe metabolism of B(a)P has been studied in detail and the mutagenicity or carcinogenicity of B(a)P\\nmetabolites have been examined in a variety of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and experimental animals. These\\nstudies have shown that the amount and type of metabolic activity for biotransformation of B(a)P differs\\nmarkedly among species as well as among the tissues of a particular species. Thus, it is difficult to\\nextrapolate the results from animals and cells to the humans because of inter- and intra- species\\nvariability. In this study, human fetal broncho-epithelial cells (HFBE) cultured in vitro were used as an\\nassay system to investigate the genotoxicity of the metaboltes of BrajP for a better understanding of the\\nrole of B(a)P in human lung cancer initiation.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nMaterials\\nAnti-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxybenzo(a)pyrene (anti-BPDE), syn-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-\\nepoxybenzo(a)pyrene(syn-BPDE). 9-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene(9-OH-B(2)P), 3-hydroxybenzo(a)pyrene\\n(3-OH-B(a)P) and 7.8-dihydrodiolbenzo(a)pyrene (7,8-diol-B(a)P) were purchased from commercial\\nsources. MCDB 153 medium, restriction enzymes, reagents used for culturing broncho-tracheal epithelial\\ncells and oncogene analysis were obtained from Sigma Chemicals Co. All other reagents were purchased\\nin China.\\nCell cultures and preparation of liver and lung microsomes\\n1.\\nBronchoepithelial cell cultures.\\nTracheobronchial tissues from an abortive fetus were cut into small pieces (2x2 mm) and seeded\\nonto cover glasses coated with rat tail collagen.

Proctor\\nIntroduction\\nFEB 6 1986\\nR. A. PAGES\\nIn July 1984, London Transport decided to enforce a ban on smoking\\nin all its Underground trains. This decision presented an ideal\\nopportunity to study the effect of banning smoking on the atmosphere\\nof a heavily populated public environment.\\nInterest in the contribution of tobacco smoke to ambient air has been\\nprompted by much argument, scientific and otherwise, over the effect\\nof what is often called \"passive smoking. This paper sets out to\\ndescribe what is meant by ambient smoke, how it may be measured and\\nwhat the typical concentrations were in the case of Underground\\ntrain compartments.\\nPassive Smoking?\\nThe US Surgeon General has described passive smoking as \"the inhalation\\nby the non-smoker of tobacco combustion products from smoke filled\\natmospheres\". However, ambient smoke bears o only little relationship\\nto mainstream smoke and any comparison between 'smoking and inhaling\\nambient smoke should take this into consideration.\\n2501485188",

D. DAVIES\\n136*\\n1985\\nI. V79 INHIBITION OF METABOLIC COOPERATION (IMC) ASSAY\\nSeveral experiments were conducted in an effort to reinstitute the IMC\\nassay using a lower passage cell line. As is usual, the new cell cultures were\\nevaluated to determine their plating efficiency and response to positive\\n☐☐ control compounds. Three assays were completed. Analyses of the results indi-\\ncated that the assay was functioning normally and routine testing has begun\\n[1].\\nThe IMC activity of hydroquinone (HQ) was evaluated [2] using a concentra-\\ntion range of 0.05 to 3.0 ug/ml. As with three previous experiments involving\\nHQ, toxicity was indicated at the higher HQ concentrations. Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data indicates that dose-related activity existed for the Tower\\nconcentrations. Statistical evaluations are in progress to determine the\\nspecific activity of HQ and will be reported next month.\\nII. SOS CHROMOTEST\\nA previous SOS Chromotest experiment performed fn-house [3] using freshly\\nsmoked CSC from six model cigarettes indicated that none of the CSCs were\\nactive, either with or without metabolic activation ($9). However, these\\nresults were questionable due to the unknown efficacy of the lyophilized (+) 59\\nsystem supplied with the kit.\\nIn order to test whether the lack of activity was due to the lyophilized\\n$9 or was actually a real observation, the activity of freshly-smoked 2R1 CSC\\nwas tested using both the lyophilized S9 and the frozen $9 preparation which is\\nroutinely used in-house with S/M assays [4]. Equivalent protein concentrations\\nwere used with the two $9 systems. CSC concentrations used were comparable to\\nthose used with the previous experiment. The preliminary results indicated\\nthat while there appears to be no CSC activity using the lyophilized S9, defi-\\nnite activity was detected when using our standard frozen $9 preparation.\\nToxicity was evaluated by measuring the enzymatic activity of alkaline\\nphosphatase (produced by the bacteria) which is not under the control of the\\nSOS functions. The results indicated no toxicity existed when using the frozen\\nS9, but possible toxicity existed with the lyophilized $9 at the higher CSC\\nconcentrations.\\nFRA\\nSer o\\n2504046040",

Abstract of the Specific Alms as stated in the original application:\\nThe TATA clement is a critical regulatory region required for gene expression in a\\nvariety of promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase II. A cellular transcription factor\\ndesignated TATA binding protein (TBP) binds and activates gene expression from the\\nTATA clement. In an attempt to identify other cellular factors that bind to the TATA\\nelement, we cloned a cellular factor that we designated TMF. TMF binds to a variety of\\nviral and cellular TATA clements and functions as a negative regulator of gene expression\\nby preventing the binding of TBP. Chromosomal mapping of TMF indicates that it is a\\nmember of a gene family localized on chromosome 3p12-p21 which is a frequent site of\\ndeletions in lung and renal carcinoma. This region of chromosome 3 is the location of a\\npotential suppressor oncogene.\\nWe wish to determine the role of TMP on regulating cellular gene expression and\\ngrowth properties. The specific aims are: (1) To analyze the biochemical properties and\\nregulation of TMF. (2) To assay the gene expression TMF in normal and tumor tissue. (3)\\nTo characterize the genomic structure of TMF and related family members. (4) To\\ndetermine the role of TMF on reversing the malignant properties of renal and lung\\ncarcinomas. These studies should be useful in determining the function of TMF and how it\\nmay be involved in regulating cellular growth properties.\\n6.

CROUSE and ROSS M. DEPINTO\\nLorillard Inc., Greensboro, North Carolina, U. S. A.\\nEXCERTin\\nMODICAT\\n1989, FEB, 1-4\\nINTRODUCTION\\nEnvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is present in the indoor air of places where\\npeople smoke. Considerable attention is currently focused on ETS because of\\nreports (1, 2) concluding that long term exposure to ETS is associated with\\ndisease. However, these conclusions come from epidemiological studies lacking\\nvalidated measures of ETS exposure. In response to this deficiency, researchers\\nthroughout the world are analyzing indoor air to assess ETS exposure in field\\nsettings. Currently, efforts are hampered by the lack of an ideal indicator (2)\\nof ETS. Nicotine and respirable suspended particles (RSP) have found the\\ngreatest use as surrogate indicators of ETS exposure; nevertheless, until fairly\\nrecently, few investigations involved measurements of both indicators. Against\\nthis background, some have attempted to evaluate or predict concentrations of\\nnicotine or RSP by assuming that defined ratios of the two substances exist.\\nUsing nicotine and RSP data from field surveys, we show here that the\\nrelationship between the two is too weak for purposes of either evaluation or\\nprediction.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\n88800118\\nData are from surveys performed in three public, environmental categories:\\noffices (3, 4), restaurants (3, 5), and passenger cabins of commercial aircraft\\n(6). For the surveys, RSP and nicotine samples were collected concurrently with\\nportable air sampling systems (4). Sampling and analytical procedures have been\\ndescribed previously (7, 8). Statistical interpretation proceeded from data\\nfor each of the three individual environmental categories. Correlations were\\nevaluated between raw and log transformed RSP and nicotine concentration values;\\nPearson's correlation coefficients were computed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\\n(9) was used to assess whether RSP to nicotine ratios were better approximated",

Cytotoxicity testico was done to aid to the selection of treatment concentrations for the alkaline elution assay.\\nThere were no resarkable differences between the two condensates. The alkaline elution test was performed ce batches 2-4 for each\\ntar. The percent difference between each set of tars was fairly consistent with the nitrate tar inducing approximately 30% less DNA\\nstrand breaks than the reference tar. The sage three sets of tars were subsitted to bacterial outagenicity testing. Nitrate tar\\ninduced a 2.65 fold increase in revertants over the reference tar in TA100. This would be expected from the increased nitroaromatic\\nconcentration. However, the nitrate treated tar induced a 1.7-fold decrease relative to reference in both TA98 and 151004 stratos.\\nThis would indicate lower levels of heterocyclic antes.
