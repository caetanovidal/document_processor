By a six\\nto one vote, the commission adopted a\\nregulation banning the advertising and it\\nwill become effective unless Congress al.\\nlows the present labelling provision to\\nlapse on July 7.\\nThe commission holds power over TV\\nand radio because of the necessity for\\nlicensing. Both use the public airways and\\nhave exclusive rights to assigned chan-\\nnels in their own territories. They are,\\ntherefore, not in the same position as\\nnewspapers and other publications, which\\nhave no such exclusive rights and do not\\nmake use of public property.\\nNevertheless, since TV and radio are\\nallowed to carry advertising, and since\\ncigarettes are legal, the commission's posi.\\ntion is unsound. It should be possible to ad-\\nvertise anything that can be legally of\\nfered for sale.\\nOn a selfish basis, newspapers might\\nbe inclined to approve the commission's\\nban. Television took in about 264 milion\\ndollars from cigarette manufacturers last\\nyear and newspaper income from them\\nhas declined to a dribble. But the pris\\nciple involved is more important than\\nlars. If the FCC is so desperately concern-\\ned about the use of cigarettes, it should.\\npropose that all sale of them be prohibited.\\n01125805\\nCigaret Advertising\\nCongress in 1965 authorized the\\nFederal Trade Commission to print\\na health warning notice on every\\npackage of cigarets sold. At the\\nsame time, as a sop to the tobacco.\\nIndustry, it ordered there should be\\nno restrictions on cigaret advertising\\nuntil June 30, 1969.\\nThat date is now approaching. The\\nIssue is joined by the fact the Fed-\\neral Communications Commission\\nhas proposed the complete ban of\\nradio and television advertising, if\\nCongress lets it have authority in\\nthis field.\\nSo another battle royal will be\\nJoined in coming weeks. The good\\nguys will argue that since cigarets\\nhave been proved a serious health\\nmenace, the advertising of them\\nover broadcast media should be halt-\\ned to keep the young in particular\\nfrom being enticed.\\nThe bad guys will refute the charge\\nas best they can. Cigaret advertisers\\nprovide the broadcasters with sev\\neral hundred million dollars annual-\\nly, and this they are not going to\\ngive up willingly.\\nThe broadcasters have other fac\\ntors working in their favor. Several\\nmembers of Congress have radio or\\nTV interests. Still more have close\\npersonal friends and campaign con-\\ntributors among big names in the\\nworld. There is a conflict of interest\\nhere, but it will be resolved in fa-\\nvor of the status quo.\\nUnless the public becomes much\\nmore concerned about this matter.\\nthan it yet has been, the bad guys.\\nare much more likely to prevail.

Liq-\\nuor is pretty much a regulated industry, at\\nleast at the retail level, where strict licens\\nIng and policing are applied. Moreover, the\\noveruse of bottled spirits produces intoxi\\ncation that represents a menace to society.\\nCigarettes are quite another story.\\nWhite the medical case against them is\\npersuasive, the smoker represents only a\\npotential menace to himself, not a public\\nmenace.\\nSo where do cigarette commercials go\\nfrom here?\\n1\\nWELL, FOR ONE THING, it is feasible.\\nthat the broadcast industry could limit\\nthem to hours when the proportion of\\nyoung listeners and viewers is small.\\nFor another thing, it might be a salua-\\ntry idea to take the glamor, the stridency\\nand the sheer iodiocy out of these commer\\ncials.\\nIt may well be that the offensive nature\\nof the average cigarette commercial has\\nbeen as responsible as anything else for\\nkindling the ire of the FCC, not to mention\\nmillions of intelligent Americans.\\nNOR SHOULD THIS MEAN reverting\\nto the competitive numbers game about\\ntar and nicotine content.\\nNot many viewers and listeners can dis\\ncem a \"good\" milligram figure from a\\n\"bad\" one, so the end is confusion.

As long as cigarettes are ac-\\ncepted as safe enough to sell, the ad-\\nverlising of competitive brands, with-\\nin the limits of truth and decency,\\nshould not be restricted.\\nCongress isn't likely to permit the\\nFCC to carry out its threat. which\\nwould amount to bureaucratic sup-\\npression. Perhaps the agency realizes.\\nthat; but the fact that such an edict\\nis contemplated seems to reflect the\\ndistorted self-image of power this\\nfederat commission has assumed and\\napparently seeks to exercise.\\nNot that we advocate the smoking\\nof cigarettes; they MAY well be, as\\nthe labels maintain, a potential men-\\nace.

Of these bills, four were\\nadopted, three in 1983 and one in\\n1982. One increased the number\\nof cigarettes that could be con-\\ntained in sample packages from a\\nminimum of 10 to a maximum of\\n20, while the others restricted, in\\none way or another, the distribu-\\ntion of sample goods.\\nThe increased legislative activity\\nin this field may be due to a swell-\\ning tide of discontent expressed by\\nmany wholesalers and retailers\\nwho see this practice as a threat to\\ntheir continued existence.\\nBefore the proliferation of\\nbrands, packings and sizes in the\\ncigarette field, the industry was\\ndominated by six major brands\\nand characterized by a strong\\ndegree of consumer loyalty to the\\nbrand each consumer smoked. Dis-\\ntributing of cigarette samples to\\nconsumers was not a particularly\\nefficient way of switching ciga-\\nrette smoking habits. It was there-\\nfore restricted primarily to the\\ncreation of good will in the form\\nof giving away cigarettes at ban-\\nquets and other celebrations.\\nTimes and mores have changed.\\nFree cigarettes are no longer\\nfavored at banquet tables. More-\\nover, where six brands dominated\\nthe market, there are now approx-\\nimately 40 brands competing for\\nthe consumer's attention, and new\\nbrands are introduced on a regular\\nbasis.\\nIn this unstructured, atomistic\\nmarket, cigarette manufacturers\\nare scrabbling frantically for pro-\\nmotional devices to increase their\\nrespective market shares. One of\\nthe most effective techniques is\\ngiving away free goods or samples.\\nWhile sampling is the most highly\\nvisible of the new techniques,\\nequally pervasive is the merchan-\\ndising ploy of \"buy one-get one\\nfree\" or \"buy one-get two free.\"\\nAlthough these techniques may\\ncause temporary shifts in market\\nshare among the manufacturing\\ncompanies, the end result is fewer\\ncigarettes are sold by retailers and\\ntheir wholesale suppliers. Even\\nwhen the volume of sales is not\\nreduced, the dollar volume of the\\nretailer and wholesaler is, and the\\nmargin of profit and survivability:\\nof the small retailer and the\\nwholesale tobacco distributor is\\nmenaced\\nThere is a strong feeling that in\\ntheir frantic desire to improve inte\\nmarket standings, cigarette manu-\\nfacturers may be killing the goose\\nthat lays the golden egg and de-\\nstroying the infrastructure of that\\nnationwide network of pinpoint\\ndistribution upon which the health\\nof the trade and the industry\\ndepends.\\nMoreover, it has been pointed\\nout that in many states which have\\na cigarette sales-below-cost law,\\nthe use of free goods through\\nretail outlets may result in the\\nviolation of the \"Combination\\nSales\" provisions of many of these\\nlaws. The NATD model sales-\\nbelow-cost law provides, in part,\\nthat in all sales involving two or\\nmore items at a combined price,\\nthe retailer's selling price shall not\\nbe below the cost to the retailer of\\nthe cigarettes included in such\\ntransaction and the invoice cost,\\nwhether paid by the retailer or\\nany other person, of all other com-\\nmodities included in such transac\\ntion. The \"free goods\" approach.\\nto cigarette sales promotion hovers.\\nperilously close to violation of the\\nletter of this provision.\\nWhether or not the law itself is\\nviolated, there is a strong feeling\\nthat, in terms of the economies of\\nthe situation and the best interests\\nof the industry as a whole, exces.\\nsive use of free goods and samples\\nwill be detrimental to the entire\\nindustry.\\nIf you are interested in further\\ninformation, the Tobacco Mer.\\nchants Association devoted their\\nOctober 13 State Bulletin (83-38)\\nto state legislation concerning the\\ndistribution of free samples.

As a result, he last year\\npaid a premium of 72 cents per pound for his to\\nair conditioned dehumidified tobacco warehouses.\"\\nThe warchouses are controlled to a temperature\\nof approximately 62 degrees, and a humidity level\\nbelow 50 per cent.\\n“,\"\\nOther health and sanitary precautions have\\nprompted Dr. Carl to note that \"our manufacture\\ning cities are cleaner than a dairy.\"\\nThe plant, located just beyond Greenlawn Ceme-\\ntery on Sunter Highway, is teased by Sorensen on\\na long-range basis, and houses the company's gen.\\neral offices and ananufacturing facilities.\\nAt present, Continental has two cigarette-making\\nmachines, one for producmg regular cigarettes, the\\nother for manufacturing tipped-end cigarettes.

Sorenson hopes to bring his ca\\npacity, through the addition of about 20 cigarette\\nnakers, up to 500,000 cases per year.\\nEven so, Sorenson estimates, such an output would\\ngive Continental only about eight-tenths of one per\\nkent of tho giant U.

A\\ncarton of cigarets that retails for $1.95\\nor less in North Carolina may sell for as\\nmuch as $4.50 through legitimate outlets\\nin New York City. Some smugglers sell\\ntheir contraband to individuals In New\\nYork City at about $1 a carton less than\\nthe legitimate price; others put counter-\\nfelt state and local tax stamps on the\\ncigarets and \"wholesale\" them at smaller\\nper-unit profits.\\nThough the problem is acute in New\\nYork, It also concerns revenue officials\\nin other states. Last week, tax and law\\nenforcement officials from 13 states met\\nhere to work out co-ordinated plans to\\nbattle cigaret smuggling.\\nSending representatives to the meet-\\ning were: Connecticut, Delaware, Michi-\\ngan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South\\nCarolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Vir-\\nginia, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and\\nWashington, D.C., as well as New York\\nCity, New York State, and the host state,\\nMaryland.\\nSpecial Detective Unit Created\\nRoy M. Goodman, New York City -\\nnance director, estimates that the city will\\nlose $9,000,000 in revenue in fiscal 1906 as\\na result of the smugglers' efforts. So Berl-\\nous is the situation that the New York City\\nPolice Department has set up a special\\ndetective unit to cope with it.\\nAccording to Chief Inspector Sanford\\nD. Garelik of New York City, \"large, or-\\nganized racketeer interests\" have stopped\\nother illegal activities, like narcotics and\\ngambling, in favor of cigaret smuggling.\\nLouls Goldstein, Maryland state comp-\\ntroller, declines to estimate how much of\\nEn inroad smuggled cigarets have made in\\nMaryland. So far, he belleves it is slight,\\nowing to vigorous enforcement. But the\\npotential danger to the state's take from\\nits 6-cents-a-pack cigaret tax (annual\\ngross: $25,000,000) is enough to worry him.\\nSince November, Maryland authorities\\nhave arrested 45 persons on cigaret-\\nsmuggling charges and seized some 500,-\\n600 packs of cigarets. Most of the contra-\\nband was headed for New York.\\nWorse Than Prohibition\\nThe largest single haul was made in\\nFebruary, when Maryland state police ar-\\nrested two Brooklyn, N.Y., men on U.S.\\nHighway 50 and found 4,500 cartons of\\nvarious brands in the van they were driv-\\ning.\\nEdward F. Englebert, Jr., head of\\nMaryland's sales tax division, says the\\nsmugging racket has blossomed into \"a\\nmammoth operation to rival the old days\\nof Al Capone.\" Mr. Englebert adds: \"It\\nis worse than Prohibition of the 1930s be-\\ncause in those days people were at least\\nmildly conscience-stricken, or worried\\nabout buying poisonous bottle of booze.\\nBut the attitude today seems to be\\nthat a package of cigarets is just a pack-\\nage of cigarets. Who cares where it comes\\nfrom? But I tell you this is backed by or-\\nganized crime-and it's getung bigger\\nevery day.\"\\nMost of the drivers arrested so far\\nhave appeared to be novices, dupes of the\\ncrime bosses behind the racket, according\\nto Mr. Englebert.\\nOSSZVOCOOT\\nAttorney General Ketuses\\nThe task of Maryland law authorities\\nwas made easler by the recent sesalon of\\nthe General Assembly, which upgraded\\nthe crime of transporting cigarets illegal-\\nly from a misdemeanor to a felony and\\ngave authorities the power to confiscate\\nthe vehlete in which they are trans-\\nported.\\nIn North Carolina, Qov. Dan K. Moore\\nsaid, \"I do not condone any violation of\\nlaw\\nand if any illegal activities are\\nbased in North Carolina we woulì be\\nmost happy to co-operate with our sister\\nstates in breaking up such activities.\\nOne of the governor's aldes said that to\\nhis knowledge no other state has yet asked\\nfor help from North Carolina authorities.\\nFederal authorities have not entered\\nthe cigaret-smuggling picture. Mr. Gold-\\nstein and other state officials think\\nthe Government should throw the FBI into\\nthe fight under the Jenkins Act, which is\\naimed at stopping the sale through the\\nmails of untaxed cigarets into a state\\nthat has cigaret taxes. But Attorney Gen-\\neral Nicholas Katzenbach has held that\\nthe Jenkins Act applies only to mail sales.\\nIf that is true, says Mr. Goldstein, the\\nlaw should be broadened by Congress.\\n\"No one anticipated a situation like this.\"\\nMr. Goldstein says. \"It's like bootlegging\\nwhisky; when it once starts, where does\\nIt stop?

The\\nAdvisory Committee on Revision of\\nthe Criminal Law has recommended a\\nnew law banning smoking for anyone\\nunder 15 and making consent of par-\\nents necessary for anyone between 15\\nand 18. It would be a misdemeanor to\\nfurnish tobacco to anyone barred from\\nhaving it by law, just as the present\\nlaw provides.\\nJuvenile experts do not believe that\\npassing a new law will solve the smok-\\ning problem. Of course it will not.\\nThere is widespread, genuine concern\\nand recognition of problems in smok-\\ning by children. Health hazards, for\\nexample. What can the schools do\\nabout it? What can parents do? And\\nchurches? A new, workable law that\\nstands some chance of enforcement\\nmay help in a measure.

What's new is\\nthat a commitee of experts has decided it is convinced\\nby the evidence available. The evidence itself is the\\nsame as before this report.\\nS\\n✓\\nNevertheless, the report represents the conclusion\\nof a panel of scientists whose ability to evaluate the\\nevidence has been generally accepted. It is an official\\nopinion by a highly qualified group.\\n\"\\nThat opinion is unfavorable to cigarette smoking,\\nfrom a health standpoint. Its biggest effect is ex-\\npected to be long-range, in discouraging young people\\nfrom taking up the cigarette habit. That gives the in-\\ndustry time to make adjustments in anticipation of re-\\nduced sales in the future, and to conduct further re-\\nsearch to isolate and eliminate any harmful elements\\nin cigarette smoke. It still is possible that a way may\\nbe found to make smoking less hazardous than the\\nreport says it is.\\nMeanwhile, some comparative reports would seem\\nto be in order, showing how the health hazard of\\nsmoking rates along with other health hazards. The\\nperson whose habits are such that he is exposed to sev-\\neral other health hazards, is far from being assured of\\na long and healthy life by not smoking. It is not to be\\nassumed that the federally-sponsored report on smok-\\ning was issued to a nation whose health habits are\\ngood. The hazard of obesity, for example, has been\\nwell established in the years while the smoking hazard\\nstill was under study.\\nThe report on cigarettes and health is much as ex-\\npected. Its impact is eased by other reports over a 10-\\nTear period. The record of tobacco sales shows reac-\\nMon and recovery after these other reports, and that\\nmay be the case again. No sudden, drastic decline in\\nales is expected.\\nThe federal government and most states have a\\nstake in tobacco sales, which are an important source\\nof tax revenue. Farmers have a tobacco control pro-\\ngram which is more nearly self-sustaining than most.\\nWhile it could be hurt by adverse legislation, the to-\\nbacco industry is not in a highly vulnerable position.\\nIt should be able to survive the immediate effects of\\nthe report and prepare for long-range effects, revers-\\ning them if possible with action to make smoking\\nDafer.",

Some\\nwill say that the tobacco industry should\\nnot be allowed to advertise. Some will\\nsay that the type of advertising should\\nbe censored.

(We are willing to concede\\nthat cigarette smoking probably is harm-\\nful, but there is still a wide area of dis-\\npute on how harmful and what harm\\narises from what degree of smoking).\\nBut the most serious danger of such a\\npolicy as this is the undeniable paternal-\\nism from which it arises.\\nThe idea is that the FTC knows best\\nwhat is good for the individual and so the\\n+\\nregulated) must do as it says.

Reilly and because EPA has no authority to regulate indoor\\nair pollution. But if approved by Reilly, the report, several years in the making, could\\nhave a dramatic effect on how other state, local and federal government agencies\\nregulate smoking in the workplace.\\n\"We are hoping that OSHA will prohibit smoking in the workplace,\" said John F.\\nBanzhat, executive director of the antismoking organization, Action on Smoking and\\nHealth. Banzhef said the report would give organizations like his potent new\\nammunition to persuade legislative bodies at the state, local and federal level to *go\\nfrom separating smokers to a virtual ban on smoking indoors.\"\\nIn addition, Banzhaf said, the report also could affect the way courts settle child\\ncustody battles and lead to court orders prohibiting smoking in homes with children.\\nEPA science advisers have been reviewing the report for several years. A version\\nsimilar to the one approved yesterday was first adopted by a separate panel of the\\nScience Advisory Board almost two years ago.\\nThe report concludes that environmental tobacco smoke causes 2,500 to 3,500 lung\\ncancer deaths per year among nonsmokers and former smokers. In addition, It says\\nthat ETS causes as many as 300,000 lower respiratory tract Infections among children\\nevery year.\\nThe tobacco industry has disputed the scientific basis of the report as It wanded its\\nway through the years-long Science Advisory Board review process. \"This report\\ndoesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense,\" Brennan Dawson, a spokesman for the\\nTobacco Institute, sald yesterday. Dawson said the report assumes \"similarities\"\\nbetween the effects of direct exposure to tobacco smoke through smoking and indirect\\nexposure by environmental tobacco smoke.\\nBanzhaf predicted the report could bring about major changes in such places as\\nrestaurants, many of which now have separate smoking and nonsmoking sections but\\nwhich in the future may have to ban smoking.\\n===============*===============\\n2028428355",

The\\nman would could become the guardian angel of an army of\\nharassed smokers is called David Warburton.\\nIn his laboratories, Professor Warburton of the Reading\\nUniversity has been studying for years the effects of the\\nsubstance \"nicotine\" on mental activities and has reached\\nconclusions which contradict the surveys which in the United\\nStates relegate smokers to the lower levels of social class.\\nAccording to Warburton, smokers are ambitious, curious and\\npersevering people who use nicotine to better their\\nperformances and their state of well-being. In this respect,\\nthe tests are quite clear: it only takes one \"puff\" to\\nincrease substantially the possibilities of success and the\\nreaction time to graphic and mathematical problems which\\nappear on the computer screen. The diagrams show that those\\nwho have not absorbed nicotine or smoked a cigarette\\n\"placebo\" without nicotine, have a definitive breakdown of\\nattention; those who smoke while exposed to the test have on\\nthe contrary quicker reactions and a higher concentration\\nwhich increases as the level of nicotine rises. The higher\\nthe nicotine level, the better the response. It is useless,\\nhowever, to increase that level over a certain threshold: it\\nis accepted that the \"useful\" nicotine is of 10 nanograms\\nfor 1000 liters of blood. The same test used nicotine\\nchewing gum with the same results but slower.\\nThe 1400 university students who took part in the research\\nwere also subjected to other tests. Warburton's team\\nexamined the results of the students' exams per exam and on\\nthe whole, to reach the conclusion that all the students who\\nsmoke have had better results during the course of the\\nacademic year and are notably more motivated than the others\\nin their studies and in their career.\\nAccording to Warburton, people who smoke do it to control\\ntheir own mental and psychological state. Some smoke to calm\\nthemselves, others to work better or for both reasons. In\\nfact, nicotine has a dual function of relaxation and\\nstimulation comparable only to the effects of sexual\\nactivity. Tobacco increases the peaks of concentration, as\\ncaffeine or amphetamines but without provoking the anxiety\\nwhich derives from the absorption of these two substances.\\nIt provokes the same state of relaxation as marijuana or\\nValium but stimulates attention at the same time.

Some of these proposals\\nbegan in response to a 1986 model bill developed by the American Medical Association, which called\\nfor a ban on cigarette sales through vending machines. Policies adopted by the U.S. Conference of\\nMayors in 1987, to \"discourage the sale of tobacco by vending machines,\" and by the National\\nAssociation of Counties in 1988, \"strengthening regulation and enforcement of activities which make\\ntobacco use accessible to minors such as.. placement of vending machines,\" also helped to spawn the\\nanti-tobacco movement against vending machine sales.\\nThe key argument used by those attempting to ban tobacco vending machine sales is that the\\nmachines are not supervised, allowing minors easy access to cigarettes. Contrary to such claims,\\nhowever, are national survey results compiled by the National Automatic Merchandising Association\\n(NAMA). In 1986, NAMA found that 80 percent of all cigarette vending machines are located in\\nplaces not frequented by minors. Subsequent surveys conducted by the vending industry, such as a\\n1988 Michigan survey that showed 95.6 percent of cigarette vending machines are located in places\\nwhere minors are not allowed or are well supervised, support NAMA's findings. Furthermore, a\\nResponse Research study of teenage smokers conducted during June/July 1989, found that only 9\\npercent purchased cigarettes from vending machines.\\nMany state and local tobacco vending machine restrictions limit machines to locations that are under\\nadult supervision or not accessible to minors, or prohibit the sale of cigarettes in government\\nbuildings. In 1989 and 1990 vending machines have become a direct target of the anti-tobacco\\nmovement. This has generated a substantial increase in proposals to ban or restrict tobacco vending\\nmachines at both the state and local levels.\\nAlaska\\nDelaware\\nIdaho\\nIndiana\\nLaws\\n992016\\nRequires tobacco vending machines to be located in places\\ninaccessible to persons under age 19, or to be under adult\\n1988\\nsupervision.\\nExecutive order prohibits the sale of tobacco products on\\nstate property by 1/1/90.\\n1989\\nRestricts tobacco vending machines to places inaccessible\\nto minors.\\n1943\\n1990\\nRestricts tobacco vending machines to workplaces or where\\nminors are not allowed access, unless operated by a locking\\ndevice.\\n1875 I STREET NW.

Anne Hancock and T CARR!\\n| Cuina Hospital, Manchester, M120, 98X: and Clutterbridge Hospital, Beringron, Merseysian. 142. GP2\\nEngland.\\nA human lung tumour cell line has boon grown in\\nserum-free medium for 12 months and during this period\\ncells were subcultured every 4 days. The culture medium\\ncontained an angiogenesis factor which has been purified\\nand shown to be similar to that isolated from other\\nsources including solid tumours. This is the first report\\nthat demonstrates, de novo synthesis and secretion of an-\\nglogenesis factor by a cell line adapted to grow in a serum-\\nfree medium.\\nThe growth of a solid torrour beyond the size of a\\nfew millimeters in diimneter is dependent on the induc\\nmọn of new blood vessels from the surrounding host\\ntissues (Folkman. 1974). This process is thought to be\\nmediated by the secretion of a soluble factor tumour\\nangrogenesis factor: TAF) which induces neovas-\\nculation in Pro and stimulates proliteration and\\nmigration of endothelial cells in vitro (Zetter, 1980;\\nKeegan et al., 1982). Angiogenesis factors have been\\nextracted from various tumour tissues, and serum-free\\nwashies of tissue-cultured tankar cells also yields an\\ngiogenic activity (Kingsnure er af.. 1976: Phillips and\\nKumar, 1979, Auerbach, 1981). However, neovas\\ncularization also occurs in several normal and\\npailislogical situations, such as wound healing. dia-\\nhengs, psoriasis, arthritis, myocardial infarction and\\nembryogenests, and factors resembling IAF appeal to\\nThe involved (Kumar. 1990; Auerbach. 1981; Kunior et\\n1983; for a recem review and adistracts related to\\nangiogenesss see Fenselau. 1983).

Asthma was excluded\\nin order to distinguish more clearly the\\neffect of passive smoke exposure on al-\\nlergic sensitisation.\\nMethods Thirty six relevant publications\\nwere identified after consideration of 692\\narticles selected by electronic search of\\nthe Embase and Medline databases using\\nkeywords relevant to passive smoking in\\nchildren. The search was completed in April\\n1997 and identified nine studies of IgE in\\nDeonates, eight of IgE in older children,\\n12 which included skin prick tests, and 10\\ndescribing symptoms of allergic disease\\nother than asthma or wheezing. A quan-\\ndiative meta-analysis was possible only for\\nthe studies reporting skin prick tests.\\nResults Several large studies failed to\\nconfirm early reports of a substantial or\\nstadstically significant association of ma-\\nternal smoking with concentrations of toral\\nserum IgE in neonates or in older children.\\nNo consistent association emerged be-\\ntween parental smoking and allergic rhin-\\nHus er eczema. Few of these studles\\nadjusted for potential confounding vari-\\nables. The quantity and quality of evidence\\nwas greatest for skin prick tests, and sted-\\nies of parental smoking during pregnancy\\nor infancy were broadly consistent in\\nshowing no adverse effect on prick pos-\\nitivity (pooled odds ratio 0.87, 95% con-\\nfidence interval (1.62 to 1.24).

A veteran pipe-puffer, he was a member of the school\\nboard when it banned smoking.\\nThe state legislature's Public Health and Safety Committee is\\nnow considering a half-dozen proposals to further limit smoking.\\nButs have been submitted to prohibit smoking in school and\\ncollege classrooms, gyms, and auditoriums, in retal establish-\\nments, elevators, and health-care facilities, at food counters, in\\nall state-owned or operated buildings, and in offices employing\\nnon-smokers.\\nEarlier this month, the Rhode Island legislature over\\nwhelmingly approved a law banning smoking in museums,\\nschools, elevaters, theaters, libraries, buses, supermarkets, and\\nSee SMOKING, Page 24\\nSmoking\\n(Continued From Page 5).\\nhospitals, except in designated areas.\\nThe piecemeal and loophole-ridden measures are in marked\\ncontrast to an order issued by Connecticut's colonial legislature.\\nthe General Court.

    "text": "\"\\n✓ Superman and the Marlboro woman\\nThe lungs of Lois Lane\\nPAUL MAGNUS, MB, BS\\nSince its release by Warner Communications in 1980, the\\nfilm Superman II bas been viewed by millions of children\\nand teenagers around the world in theaters, on commercial\\ntelevision, and on video recorders. They have marveled at\\nthe high-tech adventures of the comic book hero who has\\nfought for truth, justice, and the American way for nearly\\nhalf a century. As expected Superman saves the day against\\nassorted super-criminals. But in addition, Lois Lane, his\\nromantic interest, plays a prominent role. On the one hand,\\nshe is a bright, independent, and daring reporter on The\\nDaily Planet. On the other hand. she is sexy, romantic, and\\nsubmissive to the muscular superhero.\\nLois Lane, role model for millions of teenage girls and\\nchildren, also smokes cigarettes, the product that kills more\\npeople than alcohol, other drugs, and automobiles.com\\nbined. Moreover, in Superman II there are numerous im\\nages, both fleeting and lingering, of her brand of ciga-\\nrettes Marlboro--the world's number one seller, manu-\\nfactured by Philip Morris, Inc, New York. Consider this\\nscene: Lois Lane and Superman's alter ego, reporter Clark\\nKent, are hurrying through the offices of The Daily Planet.\\nLois has a cigarette in her mouth. They enter a room where\\nshe begins to squeeze some orange juice. There is a close-up\\nof a cigarette dangling from her lips while she tours the\\nbenefits of vitamin C. As she stubs out her cigarette in a\\nFilthy ashtray, she talks of the \"natural\" quality of the or-\\nange juice.\\nThis contrived scene-the camera zooms in on the ash-\\ntray just as Lois says \"natural\"-brings a healthy laugh\\nfrom the adults in the audience, Without doubt, this was\\na deliberate, playful dig about the unnaturalness of cigarette\\nsmoking and Lois Lane's contradictory health priorities.\\nYet, moments later, the camera focuses on Lois' Marl-\\nboro cigarette pack. What seemed to be a message that\\nmocked smoking becomes confusing. How did a brand of\\ncigarettes get in on the act? What comes to mind is the\\nironic imagery of the long-running advertising campaign\\nfor Virginia Slims cigarettes, also manufactured by Philip\\nMorris. The advertisements feature two old-fashioned,\\nsepia-tone photographs at the top of the page with a caption\\nthat pokes fun at the misfortunes of women who dared to\\nsmoke in the cruel male-dominated world at the turn of the\\ncentury. The larger part of the advertisement, in full-color,\\nfeatures an attractive, smug, and inviting woman holding\\na cigarette, and the headline, \"You've come a long way.\\nbaby. Could a bit of self-effacing humor by Lois Lane\\nactually have been intended to accentuate the positive image\\nof the woman who smokes?\\nAddress compondence to Dr. Mega Medical Assonar, Nation Hear\\nFoundation of APO Box 2 Wade, ACT 2606.\\nEven those who do appreciate the cigarette-orange juice\\ngibe may just as easily empathize with Lois. People seem\\nto be giving smokers a hard time these days. It makes Lois\\nLane more vulnerable, endearing, and \"womanly.\"\\nQuestions also arise concerning other scenes in the film.\\nIn one scene Lois Lane drags on a cigarette: she is dressed\\nin red and white, the colors of Marlboro. In another scene\\nof a climactic battle with super-powered criminals (Figs).\\na truck with a bright red and white Marlboro logo is seen\\nin the center of the screen. Superman is hurled into the\\ntruck, and he then fends off an attacker, with the cigarette\\nbrand logo in the background. The truck is then rammed\\nby a bus hurled by one of the super-villains, burying Su-\\nperman in the wreckage. After a worrisome pause, Super-\\nman emerges through the Marlboro logo. As an added\\ntouch, a taxi with a Marlboro advertisement appears in\\nconstant view in the background.\\nMarlboro is thus dramatically linked to both the super-\\nhero and the heroine. The pulling power of a clean-living\\nuniversal legend is exploited by a commercial trick. Philip\\nMorris has achieved an important recruiting message. For\\nan undisclosed consideration, the moviemakers permitted\\nrepeated juxtapositions of a children's hero with a brand of\\ncigarettes.\\nThis hypothesis was confirmed by two sources associated\\nwith the film. According to one, the Lois Lane-orange juice\\nscene was intended to be taken in the context of the first\\nSuperman movie, released in 1978. In a scene in that film,\\nSuperman used his x-ray vision to view Lois Lane's lungs.\\ncommenting that she really should not smoke. Taken in\\ncontext, the message in the original scripts of both films was\\nmeant to discourage smoking, it was said. The Superman\\ncharacter has always shunned tobacco and alcohol. In En-\\ngland his picture has been lent to an anti-smoking cam-\\npaign.\\nThen why have Lois Lane smoke in the first place, and\\nwhy the repeated identification of Marlboro? Both sources\\nacknowledged that the cigarette brand appearances were\\nno accident. One source admitted that it was \"most unfor-\\ntunate.\"\\nIt is possible that Philip Morris was not concerned with\\nthe message about smoking, as long as the viewer under-\\nstood that when one smokes, one smokes Mariboro; and\\nwhen there is a cigarette truck, it is a Marlboro truck. Yet\\nnot even tobacco wholesalers or Philip Morris representa-\\ntives from several cities interviewed for this report could\\nrecall having seen similar Marlboro trucks. The lone ex-\\nception was a public relations person for Philip Morris in\\nNew York, who insisted that such trucks exist in the United\\nStates. This person claimed that it was the moviemakers\\nwho approached Philip Morris for help with authentic\\nbackground props, as is done in the movie business.\\n342\\nNEW YORK STATE JOURNAL OF MEDICINE/JULY 1985\\nTIMN 268400",

    "text": "Integrity in Science\\nLewis M. Branscomb\\nViews\\nMuch of the problem of honor-or lack of\\nhonor-in science stems not from malice\\nbut from self-deception\\nIn 1945 a physics graduate student at Harvard began a\\nPh.D. thesis project involving the use of molecular\\nspectroscopy to determine the temperature of the atmo-\\nsphere 1,000 km above the earth, at that time quite\\nunknown. The Schumann-Runge bands of molecular\\noxygen had been observed as very weak emissions from\\nthe upper atmosphere. It was thought that they could be\\nused as a thermometer, subject to verification in labora-\\ntory studies. But the bands had been observed only in\\nabsorption at very high pressures. Then in 1948 there\\nappeared in Nature a report that stated that the Schu-\\nmann-Runge bands had been observed in emission.\\nexcited at low pressure in a high-frequency discharge.\\nThe author also analyzed the molecular constants of the\\nstates involved (1).\\nDelighted to find from the literature that his thesis\\nproblem could be successfully attacked, the student set\\nabout reproducing the experiment described in Nature.\\nAfter months of fruitless effort, he became suspicious\\nthat the results reported were in error and even that the\\nphotograph published with the text was not a picture of\\nthe Schumann-Runge spectrum at all. Indeed, it ap-\\npeared that the results might have been fabricated from\\nthe proverbial whole doth. In any case, six months of a\\npredoctoral fellowship were lost, and another way to\\ntackle the thesis problem had to be found.\\nI was that graduate student, and I have always felt\\nsorry for the author of the article in Nature, who must\\nhave been under terrible pressure to show something for\\nhus efforts. I doubt that he had any intent to injure\\nanyone, certainly not an unknown student thousands of\\nmiles away.\\nI believe that there are very few scientists who\\ndeliberately falsify their work, cheat on their colleagues,\\nor steal from their students. On the other hand, I am\\nafraid that a great many scientists deceive themselves\\nfrom time to time in their treatment of data, gloss over\\nproblems involving systematic errors, or understate the\\ncontributions of others. These are the \"honest mistakes\"\\nof science, the scientific equivalent of the \"little white\\nlies of social discourse. But unlike polite society, which\\nLagis M. Branscomb is Vice President and Chief Scientist of the IDM\\nCarponition, President of Sigma Ki, and a past president of the American\\nPhysical Society. He joined rom in 1972 after a 21-year carer at the\\nNational Burau of Standards, of which he became director in 1959: He\\nught physics at several universities, was editor of Reviews of Modem\\nPhysics, and conceived and chatred for sepent! vers the joint Institute for\\nLaboratory Astrophysics at the University of Colorido. Or. Branscomb was\\nappointed by President Carter to the National Science Board in 1979 and was\\nelected chairman the following your, serving until 1984.

This is a tough sentence to pass on an\\notherwise talented scenäst.\\nThe pressures on young science faculty are ofter\\nBerce, not so much from tenure committees or even from.\\npeers, but from within. A young untenured scientist has\\nall his emotional eggs in one basket. He picks a research\\nproblem and invests a year or more in its pursuit.\\nCerting a successful start is important to the opportunity\\nto do research. A lifetime career hinges on nature's\\ncooperation as well as his own diligence and ingenuity.\\nAs we are reminded on television, it is dangerous to\\ntrifle with Mother Nature. Sdentists run that risk every\\nday. It takes a very self-confident young scientist to\\nLaugh at Tom Lehrer's 'Lobachevsky\" without a twinge\\nof fear.\\nThe Sigma Xi project on Honor in Science must deal\\nwith the broader question of the integrity of scientists'\\nbehavior, not just with the morality of what is admitted-\\nly the more serious evil, deliberate cheating (2-5). Unless\\nscience students are thoroughly inculcated with the\\ndiscipline of correct scientific process, they are in serious\\ndanger of being damaged by the temptation to take the\\neasy road to apparent success. And outright cheating\\nan best be contained if the standards in all disciplines\\nare held at high levels.\\nWhen is an experiment complete?\\nThe reader may feel that the rules are simple and easy to\\nfollow for those who care about the integrity of their\\nwork. That is not necessarily so. Take, for example, the\\nproblem of knowing when an experiment is finished and\\nthe results are ready to publish. In 1953; building on the\\nwork of Wade Fire and profiting from his help at a critical\\ntime, I succeeded in making the first laboratory measure-\\nment of the photodemchment cross section for a nega-\\ntively charged atomic ion in vacuum (6). The absorption\\nof light by the negative ion of hydrogen (H-) was\\nbelieved by Rupert Wildt to dominate the opacity of the\\nsolar photosphere. Simply put, the temperature of the\\nsun, and thus the wavelengths to which human eyes are\\nsensitive, is determined by this cross section. No one\\nknew how accurate the quantum calculation of this\\nthree-body problem might be.\\nIn order to test the calculation, Stephen J. Smith and\\nI undertook an experiment requiring an absolute mea-\\nsurement in a very complex crossed-beam apparatus.\\nAfter several years of preparation, the experiment regan\\nTIMN 352832\\n1985 September-October\\n421",
