At the same time, a patient would be placed on diet and nutritional\\ntherapy.\\nIn 1990 Mr John also developed a new technique for treating cancer (which he had patented), called\\nISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION TUMOR THERAPY Initial trials in Sweden have proven nighly successful\\nMr John belloves that when hospitala make INTRA-TUMOR THERAPY, ISCHEMIA REPERFUSION\\nTHERAPY and DIET AND NUTRITIONAL THERAPY available to all cancer patients. along with\\nchemotherapy and redlation therapy, cancer will become a highly treatable disease\\n2029170761",

D. Degree in Chemistry from the University of Barcelona.\\n2.- JOB AT THE UNIVERSITY\\nFrom 1985 I have been working in the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Universitat\\nPolitècnica de Catalunya as:\\n1986 1991: assistant professor,\\n1991 - 1996: associate professor.\\n3.- RESEARCH\\nI am working in the structure determination by crystallography of single crystals. The\\nmolecules I have been studied are:\\na) Small basic peptides.\\nb) One nucleoside.\\nc) Some oligodesoxinucleotides.\\nSteps of the structure determination:\\n1. Crystallization of the molecule (single crystal), usually by vapour diffusion technique in\\nsitting or hanging drops.\\n2.- Mounting the crystal in a capilary.\\n3.- Data collection by X-ray diffraction, usually using Cu Ka as radiation.\\n4.- Data processing, correction and reduction.\\n5. Resolution of the structure.\\n6. Refinement of the structure.\\n7. Analysis of the structure and possible relation with function.\\nThe two first cases (a and b) are small molecules, but the third one (c) are macromolecules, so\\nthe methods applied in solving structures are different. In cases a and b the structures are\\nsolved by direct methods, but in case c, the structures are solved by molecular replacement. The\\nrefinement procedure is also different according to the size of the molecule. With this knowledge\\nI am now interested in getting broader experience and enter the field of protein structure.\\nBecause of the difficulty in getting good crystals for X-ray diffraction, some\\nollgodesoxinucleotides have been preliminary studied by Raman and FTIR.",
