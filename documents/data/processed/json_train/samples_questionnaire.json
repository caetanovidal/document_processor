Why did you co.te to PM and what was the general state of the\\nresearch and development program at that time?\\ncaused\\n2. To what extent were you familiar with the scientific literature\\non the possible consequences of smoking that was relied upon by the\\nSurgeon General's Advisory Committee in preparing its 1964 report?\\nif any\\nwhich aspects of that gathering body of literature --\\nHow was that\\nyou and your colleagues in R&D the greatest concern?\\nconcern registered to upper management, if in fact it was, and how\\nthese concerns was\\nreceptive generally to\\nPM management?\\n3. In an October 24, 1963. memorandum to Mr. Cullman et al., you\\nspeculated that the tobacco industry might face greater trouble from\\ncharges that smoking was a major contributor to chronic obstructive\\nlung disease than from any other health problem. To what extent do\\nyou feel PM was responsive over the years to this potential problem\\nand how have the company's products been modified to meet this possible\\ncharge?\\n4. A little more than a month before the '64 Surgeon General's Ad-\\nvisory Committee report. an intramural memorandum regarding \"Project\\n0100 listed as a prime goal for 1964 development of a \"medically\\nacceptable' cigarette in light of the present health attitude\" and\\nadded that special emphasis ought now to be placed by the smoke chem-\\nistry group on the removal of polynuclear hydrocarbons and selective\\nfiltration of the potentially problematic nitrosamines even as both\\nnicotine and phenols had been substantially reduced by research.\\nwhat extent do you feel this goal was pursued in ensuing years and\\nhave PM'a products been modified over the past twenty-five years in\\nways not acknowledged by the present health attitude\" of 1989?\\nTo\\nS. The FM Research Center composed a memorandum dated February 18,\\n1964, on\\nthe significance of the Surgeon General's report of the pre-\\nvious month. I have a few questions in connection with this memo 1\\n(a) Did it essentially reflect your views?\\nits\\n(b) One of the memo's main objections to the SG's report was\\nalmost to tal omission of evidence on the \"possible ameliorating ef-\\nfect of filters\", which, after all, had become the dominant type of\\ncigarette by that time. Did you feel at that time that there was\\nreason to be hopeful that such ameliorating effects might in fact be\\nrealized by product modifications? Have they, in your opinion, in\\nfact been realized? (In asking this, I appreciate that the company's\\nlegal advisors may well conclude that any positive answer to\\nquestion might constitute a \"health claim\" that they say is not per-\\nmitted under the rules of the FTC. I have registered with them my\\npuzzlement over such a view and said that I am unable to find any\\nbasis - nor have I encountered anyone outside the tobacco industry\\nwho has for the conclusion that \"health claims\" cannot be made even\\nIt is against unfounded\\nif they are based on scientific evidence.\\nhealth claims\\nI understand it.)\\nthat such FTC rules are directed, as\\n--\\nthis\\nwords\\n2023228473",

    "text": "Responsible Retailer Program\\nAttachment C\\nCommonly asked questions from Retailers and Answers\\nWhat does \"comply with the elements of the We Card program mean/What are my\\nresponsibilities?\\nYou need to demonstrate that you responsibly sell tobacco products and that you comply with\\nyour state law. You need to post a sign that communicates to your customers the minimum age\\nJaw. This sign can be from the state, where available, or from the We Card program, or any\\nother responsible tobacco retailing program. And, you need to sign a Philip Morris pledge card,\\nthat we will soon provide you, with indicating your intention to uphold the law and incorporate\\n\"We Card\" or similar elements in your sales practices. If your state requires that a specific sign be\\nposted, you need to post the state required sign. And, if you suspect that a customer is a minor,\\nyou need to ask for identification. If you are not convinced that the 1.D. is valid and/or that the\\npurchaser is of proper age, you should not make the sale.\\nDo I have to use the We Card program signage?\\nNo. Any comparable minimum-age signage is acceptable. We Card, however, is an educational\\nprogram that includes tools to help you train your employees to uphold the law and so, we hope\\nthat you will use ALL of the materials in the We Card program that go beyond the customer\\nsignage.\\nHow can I get a copy of the We Card program?\\nIf you are a member of a national retail trade association (NACS, FMI, NGA, etc.) you will\\nreceive We Card program information and an order form from them shortly, so you can order a\\nWe Card program kit. If not, we will be in touch with you shortly with details about ordering\\nthe We Card program kit.\\nHow will PM confirm compliance?\\nDuring normal and customary in-store sales calis, PM will confirm that minimum-age signage is\\nposted in your store. PM will rely on appropriate enforcement authorities in your state to advise\\nwhether you have been fined or convicted of seiling tobacco products to minors.\\nWhen you withhold merchandising benefits, do you mean money or promotions, and for how\\nlong?\\nAll in-store promotions and promotion payments, plus where applicable, flex funds are\\nwithheld and/or suspended. Failure to comply with the elements of the We Card program will\\nresult in a one month suspension of Philip Morris USA merchandising benefits upon a fine or\\nconviction for selling cigarettes to a minor. A first offense will be waived for those who do\\nparticipate in the program. However, the Retailer loses its eligibility for the Responsible Retailer\\nFund.\\nIf Philip Morris USA is subsequently notified by enforcement authorities of additional fines or\\nconvictions of the store, a one month suspension of merchandising benefits will be imposed for\\neach such additional fine or conviction. If a store is fined or convicted three times withi\\n2047977578",

    "text": "April, 1999\\nDear Participant in the 1999 Strategie Learning conference:\\nPlease fill out this questionnaire and bring it to the Conference Board workshop. These questions\\nrepresent your opinions about the organization in which you work. If you are a consultant, you\\ncan answer them with regard to any single organization with which you are working. It is more\\naccurate to answer these questions for a single unit in the organization rather than the\\norganization as a whole. For example, you might look at a work team or a single department or\\ndivision within a company. For a validated organization-wide result, you would need a larger\\norganizational sample.\\nWe will be collecting this questionnaire on March 29, and using the results in the last session to\\ndiscuss the instrument's use in diagnosing areas of strength and weakness around strategic\\nlearning. We do not ask you to put your name on the questionnaire, and we will not use names in\\nreporting out results.

    "text": "GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR BASE DISPLAY\\nQUESTIONNAIRE\\nThe Sales Department has promised management that they can conduct this\\nsurvey with a quality and efficiency at least as good as professional\\nmarket research interviewers. It is extremely important that you do\\nnot identify yourself to the respondent in any way with Lorillard and\\nthat you do not in any way let your voice or your manner of questioning\\ngive the respondent any idea as to how you personally feel about the\\nsubject matter. Normally, professional interviewers are not told either\\nthe name of their client or the purpose of the questionnaire in order to\\nguard against any possibility of their opinions influencing results.\\nFor this survey you will be utilizing the name of a research firm, called\\nConsumer Evaulation Research, Inc.\\nAs in all professionally conducted research, a very high percentage of\\nthese interviews will be validated by an outside independent research\\nservice. For this reason we can only count those interviews as completed\\nin which there is a usable name and telephone number so that this validating\\ncan be conducted. Validation includes a variety of questions about the\\nsubject matter as well as when, where and how the interview was conducted\\nand the length of time which the interview took. Often these validations\\nare analyzed by sophisticated statistical techniques.\\nWHERE TO INTERVIEW\\nHalf of these interviews will be conducted on the Friday and Saturday\\nImmediately following the set-up of the display on hursday. The other\\nhalf of the interviewers will be conducted in the same store after the\\ndisplay has been up 10 days to two weeks. You will have to use your\\nknowledge of the speed of sell through so that there still will be a\\ndisplay at the time of the second interview..\\nIt is important to indicate both the date the display went up, its size\\nand the date of the interview. We estimate that approximately 10-15 pur-\\nchases will be made off a display per day and since this is a very short\\nquestionnaire you will not have any trouble covering most of these pur-\\nchases. It is important that the respondent not know that he/she is being\\nobserved. You should interview the respondent after he/she has passed the\\ncheck-out counter.\\nIn your first question you will immediately determine whether or not the\\nperson is a smoker or a non smoker. If the respondent is a smoker you will\\ncontinue to use the white questionnaire. If the respondent is a non smoker\\nyou will record this on the white questionnaire but proceed immediately to\\nthe pink questionnaire.\\nSpecific instructions for each question are given below.\\nGENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL\\nOPEN-END QUESTIONS\\nDuring the course of the interview, you will be asking several open-end\\nquestions. All of these questions should be probed fully to obtain the\\nmaximum information the respondent will provide. The following probing\\ninstructions will serve as a guide for all open-ends in this interview.\\nPROBING: Probing is of the utmost importance.\\nThe reason for probing is to get substance and meaning for general\\nstatements made by respondents. \"I like it\" means nothing unless\\nwe know WHY and WHAT specifically is liked. Take respondent's\\nstatement and make it into a question, f.e., \"Why do you like it?\"\\nor \"What do you like about it?\", \"In what way?\", \"Can you explain\\nthis in another way?\". \"What other good/bad points did you notice?\".\\n\"Anything else?\" However, do not suggest any areas or specific\\nqualities that the respondent has not voluntarily brought up.\\n84252643",

    "text": "TAKE HO\\nSupplemental Media Questions and Suggested Responses\\n1. It was recently reported that Newport cigarettes are the brand of choice for teens.\\nIs Lorillard concerned that it manufactures cigarettes that appeal to younger\\naudiences?\\nI really can't speak to Lorillard's product marketing, but as a parenting export I believe\\nthat parents must teach their kids that smoking any kind of cigarette has potential health\\nconsequences. That's why the \"Take 10\" program is so crucial – it gives parents the tools\\nto start a discussion about not smoking with their kids before it even becomes an issue,\\n2. What is your opinion of “safer cigarettes?”\\nI am not a medical expen, so I cannot corument on how “safer cigarettes” would impact a\\nsmoker's health. I would advise parents to encourage their kids not to smoke any type of\\ncigarette. Taking 10 minutes to start a dialogue on not smoking is a great way to start.\\n3. With the growing Hispanic population in the U.S., why are Take 10 educational\\nmaterials offered only in English? Are there plans to offer a Spanish version?\\nAs the Take 10 program is still in its infancy, our intention was to offer the information in\\nthe broadest means possible. Hopefully, the program materials will ultimately be\\navailable for all parents, regardless of the language they speak.\\nMy company, Active Parenting Publishers, currently offers many of our educational\\nmaterials in both Spanish and English - a very effective method in reaching a large\\nnumber of parents.\\n4. Does Lorillard intend to take the Take 10 initiative to an international level?\\nBecause the Take 10 program is in its infancy, we are focusing all of our efforts\\ndomestically. However, knowing that smoking among teens is a worldwide problem, we\\nthink it is important that all parents—no matter where—-know how important it is to talk\\nto their kids about not smoking.\\n5. How do you measure the effectiveness of the program? Is it working?\\nThe Take 10 effort is still a relatively new initiative. As the program gains momentum\\nover the years, we can better evaluate its impact. What I do know is that education\\nworks. I've been developing parent education programs for more than 25 years. That's\\nwhy the Take 10 program focuses on giving parents the tools they need to educate their\\nkids about smoking before it becomes an issue.\\n99115638",
