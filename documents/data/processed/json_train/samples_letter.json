Little, Scientific Director\\nTobacco Industry Research Committee\\n5320 Empire State Building\\nNew York 1, New York\\nDear Dr. Little\\nIt was a most\\nFirst let express my thanks to you for the opportunity of attend-\\ning the meeting with your group in New York last week.\\nprofitable mesting as far as I was concerned, and I felt that I gained\\na great deal by listening to the discussion by the experts. I hesitated\\ntalking more about toxicity largely because I felt that the main portion\\nof the discussion should have centered around the problems of attempting\\nto define normal and plastic cell growth. I did get the impression that\\nthis will be a difficult problem. This was largely from the remarks of\\nDr. Bagle at the meeting as well as some discussion that I had with him\\n'on Tuesday when I visited hin in Bethesda. This same impression was\\ngained when I talked to Dr. Margaret Murray when I visited her on Monday.\\nAnd of course, Dr. Gey's comments to the effect that normal tismes when\\ntransplanted can result in malignant growth seemed to more or less clinch\\nthe matter. This basio problem of whether or not all normal tissue at\\nany given moment is potentially malignant seems to me one of considerable\\nbasic concern. In discussing this with Dr. Eagle and also with Dr. Murray,\\nI made the suggestion, which I hope to be able to follow-up in the labora-\\ntory, that perhaps the human amdon represents a source of homogeneous\\ncalls whose potential for neoplastic change is small. I feel this way\\nbecause after repeatedly asking a number of individuals regarding the\\n'occurrence of neoplasia of the armion, I have repeatedly received nega~\\ntive answers. Certainly it would appear that at least with this partic-\\nalar cell type, the spontaneous rate of moplasms is extremely low.\\nIt\\n30 Pron the few preliminary studies that we have done with the Hola\\ncell and the tobacco amoke incorporated in the media, the impression is\\npretty clear that we have available here a system that should offer som\\ninteresting results concerning toxicity to these particular cells.\\nseems that with it some information can be gained from contiming with\\nstudies with the crude smoke, perhaps making attempts to more definitely\\nquantitate the amount of tobacco smoke introduced, and furthermore to\\nrefine the sensitivity of the method by altering the feeding mixture\\ngiven to the cell preparations. In addition to this, fractions of the\\ntobacco apke can be introduced in an attempt to pin point more specifi-\\ncally what fractions do possess the cytopathogende potential.",

We recently reported that our under 21 readership was 2.5% based on the JANE Subscriber file (women only\\nmatched to the national database housed at Centrobe for the characteristic \"Date Of Birth.\" (A 45.8% match rate was\\nrealized at the Respondent level, with 190,510 matches our of 416255 records found.)\\nIn October 1998, Nancy Brannigan-Painter of Fairchild Publications, Inc. reported our under 21 readership as 12.8% using\\nthe JANE Subscriber file and the national database of a different fulfillment company. That information was reported at the\\nHead Of Household level. Unfortunately I discovered that the data reported was for under 25 rather than under\\n21-accounting for the significant difference in readership. We no longer do business with this fulfillment company and,\\ntherefore, we cannot ask them to re-run the old report for under 21.\\nAgain, I apologize for the confusion on this point, but firmly believe that the issue has been resolved. I expect no great\\nfluctuations on the future. As always, all of us here at JANE thank you for your continued suppen.\\nSincerely,\\nbethard\\nHoward Orter\\n○\\nCC:\\nE. Dilloa\\nP. Nasay\\nS.

As Fred mentioned, you feel that the female visual is not\\nconsistent with the current CAMEL campaign and want to specifically test this\\nissue to see if it is a problem.\\nIt is our belief that we should not evaluate the executions individually but\\nrather in the context of the entire campaign. We will be able to accomplish\\nthis in the Strategic Advertising Test (SAT) which is currently underway. In\\nthis test, respondents in each of the three test cells will see either the\\ncurrent CAMEL Campaign, the Style Awareness Campaign, or the Perceptions\\nCampaign. In addition to other questions, each respondent will be asked what\\nhe liked and disliked about the group of ads shown to him.\\nAs each group\\nconsists of only four ads, each respondent will have a thorough exposure to\\nthe ads on a forced basis. From this, we should be able to determine if there\\nare any negative inconsistencies between the female visual and the current\\ncampaign.\\nWe do not anticipate a problem in this area due to the responses observed at\\nthe focus groups held in Washington, D.C. Overall, respondents perceived that\\nCAMEL was communicating the idea of a new Filters and Lights product with\\nimproved taste delivery through the Perceptions Campaign. They also believed\\nthat the visuals conveyed the thought that CAMEL was an appropriate brand for\\na variety of people. The respondents further believed that CAMEL was\\nemphasizing this idea of wider appeal through the female visual included in\\nthe execution. Some respondents noted that she was not smoking; however, this\\nwas changed in the final version used in the SAT.\\nDue to the nature of the Perceptions Campaign, we should expect some\\ndifferences with the current CAMEL campaign.

The idea of a surfboard self-liquidator\\nis also worth pursuing. We should probably check on tho\\nsuccesu of the Kool Snark promotion of two years ago.\\n50361 6995",

Johnson\\nSUBJECT: Leaf Blends Development\\nProject No.: 8392\\nProject Title:\\nNicotine Reduction of leaf Blends\\nThere is an apparent concern within the Company for the\\nrelatively low level of the tar-nicotine ratio in the smoke\\nproduced by our products. Dr. Laurene discussed this\\nbriefly in a meeting with the Research, Development and\\nQuality Control staffs on January 8, 1980. In discussing\\nthe major points of emphasis for the 1980 R&D program, he\\npointed out that we should approach a solution to this con-\\ncern for relatively low tar-nicotine ratio levels in our\\nproducts by considering the tobaccos used in the formulation\\nof them.\\nPerhaps a brief review of the evolution in tobacco usage\\nfor the production of cigarettes would clarify our present\\nposition. At the time that five non-filtered products made\\nup approximately ninety percent of the domestic cigarette\\nsales, these products were formulated utilizing domestic\\nflue-cured, burley, and Maryland strips to make up approxi-\\nmately eighty-seven percent of the tobacco blend; oriental\\ntobacco made up approximately eight percent, and processed\\nstems about five percent. The casing and flavoring techno-\\nlogy was relatively basic and uncomplicated when compared\\nto the technology that exists in the industry today. The\\ntechnology in filters, filtration efficiencies, cigarette\\npapers and dilution systems was essentially non-existant\\nand tar-nicotine ratio levels had not been conceived. The\\ndomestic tobaccos were selected from farm grades produced\\nin the lower one-half to two-thirds of the plant. The\\noriental leaf was selected from the \"American Grades\" pro-\\nduced in the upper part of the plant to achieve the rich-\\nness and fullness of odor and taste imparted to the smoke\\nupon combustion.\\nThe advent of the filtered cigarette and the increasing\\nacceptance of these products by the consumer have resulted\\nin enormous changes in the formulation of domestic cigarettes.\\n50418 9809",

Gaspar\\nRe: FOCUS GROUPS FOR PROJECT \"I\"\\nAttached to this memo is the report on the focus groups for\\nProject \"I.\" My interpretation of the groups and the thoughts\\ngiven in the report are in agreement. The groups were conducted\\nin Cincinnati on April 12 and 13.\\nBackground\\nThe focus groups were conducted to gain a qualitative reaction to\\ncigarette ideas directed at social problems connected with smoking.\\nThe bulk of the discussion centered on four ideas:\\n1.\\nA cigarette with no sidestream smoke.\\n2.\\nA cigarette with 50% less sidestream smoke.\\n3. A cigarette with a pleasant aroma.\\n4.\\nA cigarette which did not stain teeth or fingers.\\nSummary of Results\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\nSmokers will not accept any modification in their cigarette\\nwhich would adversely affect its taste. There seems to be a\\npredisposition that any changes in a cigarette tend to adversely\\naffect the taste perhaps a result of experience with low tar\\ncigarettes.\\n-\\nSmokers do feel that sidestream (or \"raw\") smoke can be bother-\\nsome to both non-smokers and smokers due to the odor and irritation.\\nHowever, they did indicate that the smoke does have some\\npsychological benefits (the aroma, the visual pleasure of\\nwatching the smoke, a feeling of comfort). Smokers were very\\nskeptical that a cigarette like this could deliver much taste.\\nA cigarette which gave off 50% (or noticeably) less smoke seemed\\nto be a reasonable compromise to many of the panel members. The\\npsychological benefits are retained, but there is less smoke to\\ncollect in a house, gather on clothes, etc. However, most\\nmembers agreed that non-smokers would remain dissatisfied as\\nlong as a cigarette gave off any smoke.\\n50441 7903",

It is proposed that an existing loan guarantee be\\nexpanded to provide this assistance.\\nBackground\\nSSI Carbon Technologies is currently the sole supplier of the extruded carbon\\nfuel source used in Project SPA. They are a small entrepreneurial company\\nwith expertise in the extrusion of materials, currently supplying high technology\\ncomponents to IEM, General Motors, Ford, GTE, PPG, etc. Due to their relatively\\nsmall size (1987 projected sales of $21 million and assets of $16 million),\\nthey have limited access to capital.\\nA fuel source supply contract was signed in late 1985. It was necessary to\\nimplement an agreement and start plant construction in order to provide\\nsufficient lead time to meet project schedules. This agreement was based on\\nan early fuel source design (the \"J\" design). During the past two years the\\ndesign has evolved to the \"K-13\" design to provide significant product benefits\\n(lower the carbon monoxide level). The \"R-13\" is a custom component rather\\nthan a commodity type item. The \"R-13\" requires additional processing steps,\\nrequiring approximately twice the level of capital to manufacture this component.\\nSSI is the sole supplier and we must use them for the intermediate term (1-2\\nyears). Additional development efforts are continuing with other suppliers,\\nhowever, we currently anticipate using SSI for the first 2.3 billion\\npieces/month. This capacity would be implemented in phases:\\nCurrent plant (at Creedmore, NC) - capacity of 100 million pieces/month.\\nCurrent proposal\\n-\\nexpand current capacity to 700 million pieces/month\\n($17.6 million of total capital required).\\nNext proposal - in 1st Quarter of 1988, authorize an expansion to 1.3\\nbillion pieces/month at Creedmore facility (approximately $6 million) and\\naddress a possible second facility () billion pieces/month level).\\nRationale/Alternatives\\nSSJ must have financing assistance to meet our fuel source needs. SSI must\\npurchase and install equipment to manufacture the \"R-13\" fuel source. In\\norder to receive production level quantities, it is necessary to modify the\\nexisting supply agreement and to expand the existing facility.\\n50614 4679",

The concentration and impact of our overall identifi-\\ncation and the young adult male orientation of this growing sport\\nare factors which make this a unique activity.\\nAs we move toward our planning for next year, the following observa-\\ntions should be noted:\\n1.\\nImprovements are needed in two key areas relating to sampling\\nand promotional products: (a) The unique, open accessibility\\nand spectator traffic flow make sampling more difficult,\\n(b) The strong orientation of this group to t-shirts and the\\nactive merchandising by the various racing sponsor/concessionaires\\nplaces our Promocional Products Group approach at a competitive\\ndisadvantage.\\nAgrest\\nBejus\\nRecommendation/Action Program\\nDiscussions with R. Powell and J. Byrd have generated a variety\\nof ideas for testing to address current needs. The focal point\\nof the test effort would be a tent and activity area which would\\nserve as a sampling distribution point, a display area estab-\\nlishing brand sponsorship to smokers, and a opportunity for\\nbroader, more aggressive merchandising of our Promotional Pro-\\nducts Group items. In effect, a grouping of current low level\\nactivities into a more concentrated area, positioned to maximize\\ntraffic flow, would heighten our brand presence at the event.\\n(This is not too unlike the VANTAGE PGA tent which is designed\\nfor a similar sampling objective.)\\nProposed testing of this activity area, accompanied by other\\nproven volume oriented and consumer involvement activities, will\\nhelp provide a much needed promotional focus to drag racing. It\\nis proposed that the test of this program would be scheduled for\\nLabor Day weekend at Indianapolis.

Anticipating that such legislation may be enacted, we have decided\\nthat it will not be prudent for us to fund further grant applications.\\nAccordingly, we have suspended review of all new and competing renewal grant\\napplications. However, we intend to meet the obligations we have to current grantees. In short,\\nthose of you who have an active grant with CTR can expect that our obligation to you will be\\nmet, but no new grant applications or competing renewals will be considered\\ndeeply regret this decision. I believe that the vicious attack on CTR by the Attorneys\\nGeneral reflected a profound misunderstanding of the mission of CTR in supporting the\\nbiomedical research community. It is unfortunate that this action will deprive the scientific\\ncommunity of $20 million dollars annually that might well be spent on important scientific\\nresearch.

This\\nis a product which is substantially different from those traditionally\\nconsidered as tobacco products:\\nAMERICAN\\nLUNG\\nASSOCIATION\\nOF WESTERN\\nPENNSYLVANIA\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\nIt does not involve the burning or chewing of tobacco.\\nIt is, essentially, a drug inhalant system, the drug being nicotine.\\nIt contains unknown chemicals in a \"flavor capsule\" which may be\\nharmful.\\n4. Tobacco is a secondary part of this product; it could be produced\\nwithout the tobacco.\\nOn the other hand, this product is substantially similar to other products\\nwhich are regulated by FDA, including nicotine gum, drug inhalant delivery\\nsystems (asthmatic and other products) and \"Favor\" a \"smokeless\" cigarette.\\nIt is in the public interest that this product receive the same scrutiny\\nafforded to all new products, so as to protect the health of the American\\npublic.\\n50763 6143\\nThis product is a cigarette substitute, and thus, has therapeutic use in\\nsmoking cessation/reduction. It is important that this product not be given\\nan unfair advantage over other products and devices which have a similar use,\\n888-0155\\n3333 Forbes Avenue\\nPittsburgh, PA 15213\\nD\\n(412) 578-8064\\nC00037",

    "text": "PUR\\nSubject: MEETING WITH SCHWEITZER RESEARCH REPRESENTATIVES\\nTo:\\nDr. M. E. Stowe\\nDate: January 29, 1979\\nFrom:\\nD. E. Townsend\\nOn January 24, John Mathews, Charles Mattina, and David Durocher\\nfrom the Schweitzer Research Department gave a presentation to members of\\nTobacco Development and Research. John Reynolds, Alan Norman, and I\\nattended the meeting.\\n-\\nMattina presented results which had been published earlier on the\\ninfluence of the cigarette wrapper on the smoke (Mattina & Selke, Proc.\\nACS Symp., 173rd ACS Meeting Agri & Food Chem Div, 1977). A comparison\\nwas made of the permeability curves (flow vs AP) of inherently porous (IP)\\nand electrostatically perforated (EP) papers. While IP and EP papers may\\nhave the same Coresta permeability (air flow at 10 cm H₂O head), it was\\nshown that the EP papers at AP<1 cm H₂O permit greater air flow and hence\\nshould behave differently on a cigarette.\\nFree burn time decreases from about 12.5 to 7 minutes/40 mm with an\\nincrease in Coresta permeability from about 5 to 100 cm/sec (constant blend\\nand citrate level).\\nThe influence of paper burn additives on combustion with respect to CO\\nproduction was discussed. Phosphate burn additive resulted in higher CO\\ndeliveries than the citrate or untreated papers. While a number of prospective\\nburn additives have been evaluated, none have been found to result in CO\\ndeliveries as low as those observed with untreated papers. Also it was\\nreported that on a per cigarette basis CO deliveries pass through a maximum\\nwith increasing citrate level. The maximum CO delivery occurs at about 0.8%\\ncitrate, a value close to that used in our commercial papers.\\nMattina presented briefly the results of a study of CO diffusion through\\nthe wrapper of a cigarette. The results have been described in detail previously\\n(Beitrage zur Tabak., 9 (4), 201 (1978)). In this study it was concluded that\\nthere is little difference in the amount of CO diffusion from cigarettes\\nwrapped in papers of widely differing degrees of natural permeability.\\nJohn Mathews discussed the permeability range of commercial papers. He\\nstated that IP papers range from 6-200 cm/sec with 170-180 as a more practical\\nupper limit.\\nElectrostatic papers range from 6-100 cm/sec in this country\\nwith a substantially higher (180-200) upper limit in Europe.\\nMathews discussed dilution air flow in vented filter tips as presented in\\ntwo earlier articles (Beitrage zur Tabak Int., 9 (4), 193 (1978) and\\nSchweitzer Tech Bulletin, Mar. 15, 1977). In a comparison of mechanical and\\nelectrostatically perforated tipping (at constant total open hole area), it\\nwas found that electrically perforated tipping allowed 2-3 times greater air\\nflow at a constant plug wrap porosity.\\nRURI FORM 2422-Anv. 7/70\\n50855 9977",

This enriches the nicotine and extractable flavor\\ncontent (without addition of exogenous nicotine or flavorants) by\\nreducing the mass of the residue. This will provide a very high\\nnicotine to tar ratio smoke and should avoid problems associated\\nwith adding nicotine to products, Jack has made the sheets and we\\nare currently determining the best way to make cigarettes and\\nplanning experiments.\\n05%\\n51294 7923",

    "text": "To:\\nD. C. Leary\\nP. F. Itterman\\nSeptember 12, 1994\\nFrom: R. C. Pasterczyk\\nRe: Minneapolis Metro Heavy Advertising Test Results - Caniel\\nMOD\\nBackground\\nIn August 1993 a heavy advertising test was initiated for Camel in the Minneapolis metro\\narea. The purpose of the test was to assess whether heavier presence had an impact on\\nmarket sales. The test included flighted OOH, continuous print, and multiple visuals, and\\nthe spending rate was at about double the national level.\\nWith the 1994 budget squeeze, national advertising spending was reduced as was\\nMinneapolis; however, the test area continued to receive support at about double the\\nnational rate. Also in April 1994, the Camel BU began a heavy retail plan that\\nencompassed five regions and included Minneapolis.\\nMethodology\\nWe attempted to evaluate this test using traditional methods during 1993 (report issued\\n3/14/94 covering August-December 1993). Results from this early read indicated no\\nnoticeable impact on sales. With Minneapolis becoming a retail heavy-up market in 1994\\nand a shift in level of advertising support, this approach did not work for subsequent time\\nperiods.\\nWe approached IRI about doing a modeled technique, but based on their cost estimate of\\n$45,000 we elected not to go with them. Instead, we utilized internal resources and Don\\nSchmidt in the BIAD Decision Support group developed the analytical approaches to\\nassess this issue.\\nThree analytical approaches were utilized: simple trend, forecasted baseline, and a\\nmodeled covariate procedure. The more sophisticated techniques provide a way to try to\\nseparate out the effects of media from the other market effects that were going on at the\\ntime, particularly pricing and promotion. All three approaches led to the same overall\\nconclusion.\\n$1476 6512",

I am\\npleased to enclose a statement describing policies of The Council and a recent Annual Report\\nthat lists grants currently supported. Our application procedure is a two step process. First, a\\nshort preliminary inquiry is sent to members of the Executive Committee of our Scientific\\nAdvisory Board who evaluate it for scientific merit and for \"fit\" into The Council's current\\nmultidisciplinary biomedical research program. If the Committee's review vote is positive.\\nyou will be provided with forms and instructions for completing a full application. In the\\nevent you receive an award, The Council will consider up to two annual renewals on the basis\\nof progress reports and materials submitted with renewal applications.\\nThe deadlines for submission of a full application are May 31 and November 30;\\nactivation is typically seven months later. CTR accepts preliminary applications continuously-\\nthose received between April 1 and September 30 that are approved are eligible for the\\nNovember deadline; those received between October 1 and March 31 and are approved are\\neligible for inclusion in the May cycle. The format for the preliminary application is as\\nfollows:\\n1.\\nA three page narrative summary. This should contain a synopsis of the proposed project\\nincluding relevant background material, its present status and goals, a brief outline of the\\nresearch and its impact. The summary should end with a sentence indicating the\\nanticipated duration of the project (one, two or three years) and a single figure estimate of\\nthe anticipated annual direct costs of the study as proposed. Please note that the three\\npage limit is absolute; no attachment pages containing photographs, charts or literature\\ncitations will be accepted. If you judge such materials are critical for the review of the\\nproposal, they must be accomodated within the three page limitation.\\n2. Two page curricula vitae and scientific bibliographies of the applicant and principal\\nprofessional level collaborators (the NIH format is quite acceptable). Again, the page limit\\nis strictly enforced; only two pages per investigator are forwarded to the Committee.\\n3. One copy each of any two or three publications, abstracts or manuscripts that are closely\\nrelated to the project for which funding is being sought.\\nEncl\\nHCM/mla\\nSincerely.\\nHammer Mc Allerto\\nHarmon McAllister",

ON 7-17-13\\nBy now you have heard from a broad cross section of the candy and tobacco distribution\\nindustry regarding your July 22 pricing announcement ... Time alone will tell how\\neffective any wholesale distributor has been in counteracting this blow to the business\\nand the way it was traditionally conducted. It will not, however, take long to assess the\\nimpact on the fabric of a long-standing supplier to wholesaler relationship. We think it is\\nworthwhile to give you our sense of what wholesale distributors are saying.\\nIn an industry whose products are attacked at every tim, mutual trust and concomitant\\nbusiness support are essential elements of survival. Unilateral action by any channel\\nparticipant has the potential to upset the delicate balance in today's cigarette market\\nPhilip Morris' treatment of its wholesale custorners exhibits a callous disregard for the\\nbusiness malides faced by long-time parmers. You have sent a message which can only\\nbe interpreted by our members and your competitors as lacking any particular\\ncommitment to the future of candy and tobacco wholesalers.\\nPhilip Morris has changed the very nature of cigarette marketing and distribution in this\\ncountry: Specifically, your actions have:\\n• Interfered with wholesalers' ability to maintain a traditional business\\nrelationship with the retail accounts by directly contacting those accounts for\\nthe purpose of trying to influence their pricing decisions while limiting the ability\\nof distributors to independently price their product;\\n•\\n•\\nDisregarded the current economic realities surrounding the distribution of\\ncigaretes and the disastrous impact your actions have had, and will continue to\\nexercise, on the ability of candy and tobacco distributors to survive, let alone eam\\na profit:\\nCrippled the essentials of thuist, respect and mutual support necessary to maintain\\na jointly beneficial distribution parmership in today's environment;\\n⚫ Fostered overt efforts on the part of PM field sales representatives to shift\\ndistribution away from candy and tobacco wholesalers in favor of alternative\\nparicipants.\\nOver the long run, these factors may combine to work against Philip Morris' plans to\\nincrease market share at all costs. Positive relationships built up between Philip Morris\\nand the distribution community over the years are damaged. We have been listening to\\nyour customers, and what we hear is not encouraging.\\nAWMA intends to do what it can to suppon wholesale distributors as they adapt to new\\nbusmess realities by helping them to competitively and profitably serve their retail\\naccounts. Should Philip Morris share this interest, we welcome any constructive advice\\nyou may wish to provide.\\nExecutive Committee\\nAmerican Wholesale Marketers Association\\n95680746",

Held, Director\\nState Prevention Systems Program\\nCenter for Substance Abuse Prevention\\nRockwall II Building, 9th Floor\\n5600 Fishers Lane\\nRockville, MD 20857\\nDear Ms. Held:\\nAs a retail trade professional, I wish to object strenuously to the official harassment your\\nagency is proposing for my industry under the guise of enforcing Section 1926 of the\\nADAMHA Reorganization Act.\\nThe original language of Section 1926 is appropriate. Congress simply requires states\\nreceiving ADAMHA block grants to enforce minimum age laws for the purchase of tobacco\\nproducts in a manner \"that can reasonably be expected to reduce\" the availability of these\\nproducts to minors.\\nThis language acknowledges that underage tobacco use -- while a legitimate issue -- is not\\nin the same league as drug and alcohol abuse, the two evils ADAMHA funds are meant to\\ncombat. It also assumes, rightly, that both the states and retailers are already committed\\nto enforcing and obeying all minimum age laws for the purchase of tobacco products.\\nThe onerous and combative enforcement language proposed by HHS, by contrast, assumes\\nan adversarial relationship with retailers and imposes upon both the states and the retail\\ntrade excessive costs and bureaucracy.\\nRules proposed by HHS would require retailers to bear an estimated $100 million annually\\nin compliance costs, HHS further suggests retailers absorb an additional $50 million a year\\nin law-enforcement costs through new licensing requirements.\\nMost distressing, HHS would subject retailers to the vigilante zeal of anti-smoking activists\\nby encouraging \"private entities\" and \"local governments\" to employ children in conducting\\nfrequent \"sting\" operations against unwary retailers.\\nEven more offensive, HHS suggests publishing the names of local stores entrapped in such\\noperations that \"consumers who would wish to steer their patronage to stores which do not\\nviolate the law can do so. Please delete these provisions from the proposed rules.\\nIn sum, the fantastic and excessive rules proposed by HHS to measure compliance with\\nSection 1926 are unnecessary. Existing state laws, in conjunction with responsible industry\\nprograms promoting compliance with those laws, are more than sufficient.\\nSincerely,\\nTH1573-2102",
