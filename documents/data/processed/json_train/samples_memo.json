Gordon\\nOctober 18, 1983\\nDATE:\\nSUBJECT: POTENTIAL PROCESS MODIFICATIONS/599\\nIn order to assist us in the development of new products, we need to\\nobtain an estimate of the impact that various process modifications\\nmay have on the Macon plant. New process and product technology is\\ndeveloping in several areas including the use of a CTO process, imple-\\nmentation of additives to tobacco, development of a longer lasting\\ncigarette, new blends and materials which are more brand specific,\\netc. These projects span the entire range from new product develop-\\nments to needed improvements on current brands. Our needs in these\\nareas are obviously immediate from an overall Corporate viewpoint.\\nHowever, we also recognize the realities of the impacts changes to our\\nprocess and materials will have in manufacturing.\\nWhat we need then is an ability to rationalize these objectives and\\nshort-term constraints. In order to accomplish this rationalization,\\nwe will need your input from the viewpoint of the degree of difficulty\\nof implementation.\\nMore specifically, we need estimates for each of our considered modi-\\nfications addressing items such as cost, timing, degree of difficulty,\\nresource needs, etc. We can then utilize this data to both guide our\\ndevelopment efforts as well as reconcile any differences in time\\nframes and priorities.\\nA list of some of the modifications we are currently considering is\\nattached. Relative to the information we need, we are not looking for\\n\"to-the-penny\" estimates. A quicker response is more important than a\\nfine-tuned estimate. At the same time, recognize that our programs\\nwill be impacted and a degree of accuracy is essential.\\n526002068",

SIR has been\\nrequested to locate 150 competitive lights 100's smokers for\\nblind paired-comparison testing versus Marlboro Lights 100's\\ncigarettes.\\nWe acknowledge Marketing's request for development of ultra low\\n\"tar\" versions of MISTY Slims Lights Filter and Menthol Ciga-\\nrettes. The ultra lights cigarettes will have the same physical\\ndimensions and basic taste characteristics as the respective\\ncurrent lights products. Preliminary models are being prepared\\nwith tobacco blends incorporating increased levels of expanded\\ntobacco and filter rods of higher pressure drop to compensate\\nfor slower burn rate and increased ventilation in the 6-mg \"tar\"\\ndelivery ultra products.\\nATX02 0221479",

To obtain data needed in support of the patent\\napplication on the flavor-impregnated carbon filter, & study was made of the\\nability of MONTCLAIR cigarettes to retain menthol when exposed to heated air\\nunder simulated smoking conditions, and a comparison made with a conventions 1\\ntype mentholsted cigarette treated in a similar maner. Also, the retention of\\nmenthol by IF Filter rods when exposed to elevated temperature for brief\\nperiods was tested.\\nOrganic elementai microanalyses and special smoke analyses have been\\nfurnished as required to other Groups in the Research Division. Three collabo-\\nrative tests of smoke analysis methods were made for the Analytical Methods\\nCommittee of the Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference.\\nA technique was developed for the determination of vanillin in MONTCLAIR\\nfilter rods and in other carbon-impregnated rods containing this flavor. Vanillia\\nmay be eluted from the rods with chloroform, extracted into alkaline solution,\\nand estimated by its absorbance at 347 mi. Menthol,cardamom, and certain other\\nflavors being considered for use do not interfere. Menthol may be determined on\\nthe same MONTCLAIR rod sample by analysis of the chloroform extract by the p-\\ndimethylaminobenzaldehyde colorimetric method.\\nPreliminary experimental work has been carried out to determine if the use\\nof carbon tips impregnated with nicotine or nicotine salts may be feasible as\\nan efficient means of increasing the nicotine content of smoke solids. With\\nthe collaboration of Mr. Bateman, filter rods containing blank JF-type carbon\\nwere impregnated with nicotine under various test conditions, and smoke analyses\\nmade on cigarettes employing the resulting filter elements. Transfers to the\\nsmoke of about 22% of the nicotine adsorbed on the carbon have been achieved.\\nha",

Lougee, III, Research and Development Director\\nReference is made to your memorandum of November 19 in which \"tar\"\\nand/or nicotine values were requested for filter cigarettes, smoking\\ntobacco, cigars and chewing tobacco.\\nThe average \"tar\" and nicotine delivered by all filter cigarettes\\nlisted on the FTC Report dated September 1974 is 15.9 mg \"tar\" and\\n1.06 mg nicotine. Using the Maxwell Report for 1974 projected sales,\\nthe sales-weighted average for filter brands is 17.0 mg \"tar\" and\\n1.17 mg nicotine.\\nThere is no accepted standard smoking procedure for \"tar\" and nicotine\\ndelivery from pipes; however, we have a method developed in this Labo-\\nratory several years ago. Using this technique and employing the\\nmost popular pipe size and shape sold in the United States (medium,\\nfull bent) and a sample size of two grams of tobacco, we obtained\\ndata from Prince Albert, HALF AND HALF, and Sir Walter Raleigh tobaccos.\\nThese brands represent approximately 75% of the popular price domestic\\nsmoking tobacco market. From these brands, the average \"tar\" and\\nnicotine delivery per pipeful of tobacco was 61 mg \"tar\" and 6.5 mg\\nnicotine. Corresponding data was obtained with a medium size straight\\nstem pipe.\\nAlthough there is no accepted standard smoking procedure for cigars,\\na proposed method has been published. We used this method and obtained\\ndata on the most popular shaped 124 cigars, White Owl Invincible and\\nROI-TAN Perfectos Extra, which averaged 37 mg of \"tar\" and 1.5 mg of\\nnicotine per cigar. We understand that the straight shape may be the\\nfastest growing segment of the 12% cigar market and could overtake\\nthe perfecto market. Analyses from the three big sellers in this\\nmarket, ROI-TAN Falcons, White Owl Ranger, and Muriel Coronas, averaged\\n46 mg \"tar\" and 2.1 mg nicotine per cigar. Three popular brands of\\ncorona size, high-grade cigare, LA CORONA #200, Boxing Imperials, and\\nCuesta-Rey #95, averaged 102 mg of \"tar\" and 10.7 mg of nicotine por\\ncigar.\\nThe greater part of the chewing tobacco market is represented by loose-\\nleaf chewing tobacco, the major brands of which are Red Man, Beech-Nut,\\nand Mail Pouch. The average nicotine delivery from a typical chew of\\nthese brands was 37 mg per chew. For comparison, two brands of plug\\ntobacco, Apple and Brown's Mule, were also analyzed and the average\\nnicotine was 86 mg per chew.\\n* For Completi Pet -\\nlogita\\n4、,,ཉ·ན༦༢\\nATC + Comp-\\n\"Far\" & \"nicative & div\\nSmoke Anal",

Tong\\nSUBJECT:\\n2\\nMethoxynaphthalene\\nSafety Evaluation\\nAcute Intraperitoneal Toxicity in the Mouse\\nThe compound was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Coporation\\n(Lot JB 111057). A 10% (w/v) solution was prepared with corn\\noil for injection in male mice (18-23 gm, ICR Sinesis/Webster,\\nCamm Research Institute, N. J.). After 48 hours of compound\\nadministration, no mortality was noted in the highest dose\\ngroup (2000 mg/kg). Although depression and labored breathing\\nwere observed 15-30 minutes post treatment, righting reflex\\nwas present throughout which indicated that no major neuro-\\nmuscular toxicity was present at that dose. The toxicity\\nsymptoms were reversible and the animals regained their normal\\nappearance and activity after 6 hours.\\nAmes' Salmonella/Microsome Mutagenicity Test\\nThe compound was tested in strain TA1535, TA100 and TA98 at\\n250, 500, 1000, and 2000 micrograms per plate. It was toxic\\nto all strains only at 1000 and 2000 mcg/plate. This means\\nthat we used adequate test doses. It was non-mutagenic\\nin all strains, with or without microsome, at 250 and 500\\nmcg/plate. This means that the compound itself and its\\nmetabolite(s), if any, are not mutagenic in this system.\\nSummary\\nIn my judgement, an inhalation dose of 0.6 mg/kg man most\\nprobably would give a safety factor of 100, which is a safe\\ndose for food additives. In this instance, a dose of less\\nthan or equal to this would be safe for a single trial.\\n01090483",

Latshaw\\nseen this report D\\nApril 30, 1969\\nPurpose\\nDuring its methods development program the Analytical Services\\nDivision noted a relatively high malic acid content (7+%) in bright\\ntobacco stems.\\nIt was also determined that malic acid could be iso-\\nlated from the bright stems through a simple water extraction pro-\\ncess. Both results indicate commercial feasibility.\\nBefore pro- 2\\nceeding further, the Analytical Division requested a market analy-\"\\nsis to determine if an opportunity exists in it for Philip Morris\\nto justify further development effort. It is the purpose of this\\nreport to analyze the market for malic acid and identify the exis-\\ntence, if any, of a market opportunity for Philip Morris Inc. in\\nthis market.\\nResearch Procedure\\nInformation generated for this report was obtained from Philip\\nMorris Inc. Research Center personnel, trade associations and publi-\\ncations, governmental agencies and publications, malic acid sup-\\npliers, a consultant firm, and a university. A complete listing\\nof these sources is presented in Appendix A.\\nSummary and Conclusions\\n1.\\nThe Analytical Services Division of Philip Morris R & D\\nhas developed a process for extracting 1-malic acid from bright\\nstems. The acid is recovered as a calcium salt. Further refine-\\nment of the salt to the acid form has not been attempted, although\\nthis can be accomplished. Since the process has been tested only\\nat the laboratory level, an engineering study would be required to\\nexpand the process to a commercial scale. A patent disclosure has\\nbeen made to Philip Morris attorneys.\\n2. The current market for 1-malic acid is as an optically ac-\\ntive reagent in biochemical applications, Although no exact data\\nare available, this market appears to be extremely small. A price\\nof $20-30/pound undoubtedly limits the use of 1-malic acid, and\\nthere appear to be sufficient sources and processes to provide ade-\\nquate material. Although food and beverages, chemical, pharmaceuti-\\ncal, and toiletries applications are potential areas suggested for\\n1-malic acid, its high price precludes its use in these markets.\\n3. A \"synthetic\" malic acid, which is a racemic mixture of\\nd- and l-isomers, has been produced since 1923. This di-malic\\n0000024939",

I don't know how\\nwe can accomplish this without sitting down with him at an \"in camera\"\\nsession and rewriting the paper on the spot.\\nThis man's meandering is holding up the volume. It may be that is what\\nsome people want; namely, that it should be held up so long it will never\\nbe published but, if the industry 13 to get any return on its Investment In\\nthis conference, we'd better get this book published.\\nDo you have any Ideas for the solution of this problem?\\nRegards.\\nencl.\\nHWake\\n1000298196",

In regard to DiPaolo's System,\\nDonovan stated that with a slight modification--he now puts\\ndown the X-irradiated rat cell feeder layers and the clones of\\nhamster embryo (HE) cells at the same time instead of plating\\nthe HE cells 24 hr after the feeder layers--he now gets an in-\\n\"creased plating efficiency of up to 30%. Donovan credits his\\nquantitative and reproducible results to his careful selection\\nof feeder layers and his ability to keep the cell environment\\nstable. He discourages the use of chemicals, such as mitomycin-\\nC, to obtain feeder layers because of the unknown effects such\\nchemicals may have on the cells. Donovan stated that the trans-\\nformed cells are able to grow to produce colonies in soft agar.\\nIn addition, he has found no virus activity in the HE Cells.\\nToxicity Tesing In Vitro - R. Nardone (Catholic U.)\\nDr. Nardone spoke on the importance of an \"ideal\" toxicity\\ntesting system and the importance of relating in vitro systems to\\nin pivo systems. The following is a list of suitable parameters\\nof toxicity which can be readily investigated with in vitro\\nsystems:\\ncell viability; cell reproduction; balanced biosynthesis%3\\ncarcinogenesis; mutagenesis; and differentiated functions.\"\\nToxicity testing should include as many parameters as pos-\\nsible and, when possible, relate to the suspected action of the\\ntest agent in vivo.

The issue of concern is minor contamination of the Baymag magnesite (magnesium\\ncarbonate) filler with organic bromides which occurred during processing through a hammer\\nill at Midwest Custom Services, Inc. The contaminating organic bromides, which are\\nroutinely milled Midwest Custom Services, Inc., are believed to be alkenyl haloary! ethers\\nand cyclic alkyl bromides (see enclosed Material Safety Date Sheets).\\nThe starting material for this process naturally contains -3.0 ppm bromine. Since the\\nmagnesite papers produced at Ecusta incorporate only 25% magnesite filler, the resultant\\npapers would have been expected to have less than 1.0 ppm bromine. Instead these papers\\nactually contained 3.1-5.8 ppm bromine. For the sake of comparison. Bob Jenkins has\\nindicated that for Kentucky 2R1 reference cigarettes, the wrapper contains 2.0±0.2 ppm\\nbromine and the whole cigarette contains 124 ppm bromine. I have asked Doug McRae to look\\nup the published data which exists on the transference of bromine, so that you and your\\ncolleagues could determine whether additional experiments need to be performed in order to\\nobtain all the information you need to make a decision concerning this request.\\nI have also included a copy of Doug McRae's memo which includes the data for the\\nbromine analyses (performed by neutron activation analysis) which are cited above.\\nThank you for your cooperation in handling this request.

The most comprehensive research into inhalation behavior appears\\nto be that done by the Behavioral Research Laboratory in 1982 [3], but it stopped short of rigorously\\nmeasuring nicotine retention although it reviewed the literature and proposed a methodology for con-\\nducting just such experiments. The Behavioral Research Division seems to have been dismanded or\\nreorganized shortly thereafter, as there are no further reports from it other than 5 (which does not\\nexamine nicotine retention). In an earlier, tess comprehensive, experiment it was found that even\\nmoderate inhalation reduced the level of exhaled nicotine below detectable limits [4]. The literature\\nreview in 3 explores the hypothesis of nicotine self-titration, whereby it is suggested that smokers\\nmodify their inhalation behavior to regulate the nicotine delivery.

The nicotine delivery averaged 50 micrograms per puff and\\nranged from zero to over 160 micrograms per puff. The differences were\\nin the number of puffs taken and the intensity of heating in the attempt\\nto light the device. For comparison, Cambridge 85 cigarettes average\\naround 20 micrograms and Marlboro 85 averages approximately 140 micro-\\ngrams per puff nicotine delivery.\\nThe experiment was done using a single port smoking machine. A 35cc,\\n2 sec. puff was used and lighting atterpts were made with a butane lighter.\\nOne or two heated puffs on one or two Favor articles were taken for\\neight trials. The nicotine was collected on Cambridge pads that had\\nbeen treated with NaHSO4 to improve trapping efficiency. 2 Nicotine\\ndetermination was done by extraction and GC analysis.3\\nThe data show a large amount of scatter which is attributed to the range\\nof heating and the number of times a single Favor device was heated\\nand puffed. It is logical to believe that consumers would also experience\\na range of nicotine deliveries due to their persistence in attempting\\nto light the device, their tolerance to the noxious plastic vapors,\\nand the size of the puff taken.

Drew\\nDate: April 11, 1991\\nSubject:\\nThe Application of Tobacco Solubles to Bright Base Web Using Two Different\\nMethods\\nIntroduction\\nThe reconstituted leaf (RL) and impaction trapped cigarette smoke condensate (IT CSC)\\nare standard materials used in analytical and biological tobacco research. Tobacco solubles,\\nfrom the cross over process, are sprayed on base web (BW) to produce the RL filler. The RL\\nfiller is made into model cigarettes and smoked to produce IT CSC. Various BCR research\\nstudies involve the modification of the burley solubles applied to the BW. Treatment of the\\ntobacco solubles may cause changes in sample consistency. A change in sample consistency\\ncan make spraying solubles on BW difficult or impossible. An alternate method of applying\\ntobacco solubles to BW would ensure the evaluation of modified tobacco solubles not suitable\\nfor spraying. In this study bright (Br) BW was soaked or sprayed with BuS1, tobacco solubles\\nto determine the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of soaking BrBW versus spraying BrBW\\nto produce model fillers.\\nMethods\\nBurley S1 (BuS1) was applied to BrBW by either the conventional spray method or by\\nsoaking. To produce a soaked sample, BuS1 was poured over the BIBW and stirred with a\\nspatula until all of the sample was absorbed. The BrBW on which the BuSI was sprayed was\\nrotated during application. Reconstituted solutions of BuS1 were applied to different batch\\nsizes of BrBW filler. Sample stock concentrations ranged from 0.52 to 0.95 g/ml. The target\\nrange for solids in each model filler was 45%. Treated fillers were air dried and equilibrated in\\na conditioned laboratory (70% RH) for a minimum of 24 hours. After air drying, model fillers\\nwere crushed to eliminate clumps, made into cigarettes and smoked. Replicate smokings were\\nconducted in experiments #3 and #4. Each cigarette weighed approximately 1.0 gram. The IT\\nCSCs from the treated fillers were made into 10mg/ml DMSO stock solutions and submitted\\nfor Salmonella (S/M) testing (1,2). To reduce the number of test plates in experiment #4, the\\n15.0 gram soaked and sprayed batch-size samples were no tested in the S/M assay (2).\\nSamples were stored at -80° C prior to testing. Model fillers were submitted to ARD for\\nanalysis.\\n2023413403",

One additional example and a few\\nfigures have been added along with some minor changes to the text. A number of additional\\nclaims need to be considered. We would like to strengthen our patent position with claims of\\nthe following;\\n1) composition of matter for the aggregates of Examples 1-4 where the magnesium\\nhydroxide is adhered to (coating) the magnesite (see Figures 3 and 4 of the draft\\napplication). The aggregates as prepared by our technique (Equation 1) are novel\\ncompositions. There are reports in the Russian literature [CA97(24):200843s] of pure\\nmagnesite being produced by a reaction (Equation 1a) similar to that used by us involving the\\nhydrothermal reaction of magnesium hydroxide (brucite) with carbon dioxide. However, no\\nreference is given to the formation of the magnesite/magnesium hydroxide aggregates that we\\nhave observed (because their reactions were run to completion, i.e., there is no magnesium\\nhydroxide present in their product). By varying the carbon dioxide amount (less than\\nstoichiometric) and/or time of reaction we are able to produce different ratios of magnesite\\nand magnesium hydroxide. What is unexpected and unprecedented is the scattered adhesion of\\nthe magnesium hydroxide to the surface of the magnesite to form, what we are calling,\\nmagnesite/magnesium hydroxide aggregates.\\nMg(OH)\\n+\\n(1-x)CO2 -> (1-x) MgCO3 + xMg(OH)2\\n+\\n(1-x)H₂O (Osxs1) (1)\\nMgCO3 + H₂O\\n(1a)\\nMg(OH)2 + CO2\\n2) The reaction (Equation 2) used to produce the samples in Examples 5 and 6 (the\\nhydrothermal treatment of hydromagnesite in the absence of CO, ) has also been reported in the\\nRussian literature (CA93(16):1532992]. This reaction was carried out to completion (i.e., to\\nthe stoichiometric amounts of magnesite and Mg(OH), ), and it is very likely that the samples\\nhave similar associations of the magnesium hydroxide to magnesite (agglomerates, or clusters,\\nof magnesium hydroxide interspersed amongst the maguesite, i.e., more like a physical\\nmixture, see Figure 5 of the draft application).\\nMg(CO3)(OH)2+4H₂O\\n--->\\n4MgCO3 + Mg(OH)2 4H₂O\\n+\\n(2)\\n2028579040",

Assuming\\nyou agree to Norma & Walchack' recommendation, they will meet with the leam Friday to\\nimplement.\\nCatalogue Sales The Distribution Task force is currently scheduled to be meeting with\\nMES the same time as the New Products committee. Beran and Heronimus are working to\\njuggle schedules to see if we can't get all the interest parties together to determine how we\\nmight learn what we need to learn and take action appropriately. Frankly, I'm hearing lots\\nof Sales support, and found John Clary to be an isolated opponent\\nMBA Recruiting - This is on our Monday morning VP agenda. We need to agree to\\nhow many candidates we are looking for summer 1994 hiring. We also have to make a\\ncommitment to fund school presentation ($25,000) and to a presentation subject. The first\\ncampus visit is slated for 11/16/93 so we need to act now.\\nYELLOW\\nVirginia Slims Creative - We'll see 4-5 executions of new print from concepts & copy\\nlines we have previously approved. We'll also have some discussion of OOH. Agency is\\nunsure that they will have the best OOH solution this week; it may still be \"work in\\nprogress\" for Miles.\\nParliament Agency We need to nail down a compensation program for BSB for 1994\\nincluding what gets paid out to their subsidiary agencies. We're working with Ginny\\nMurphey but there doesn't seem to be much clarity to arrangements in the past. We nood\\nto nail it down quickly, because Bob and Ina want to award the events part of the resort\\nprogram to an agency outside of the BSB family. Because of our move back into OOH, I\\ndon't believe BSB will be hurt year to year financially -- but it makes sense to get this all on\\nthe table now.\\n2040417143",

The\\nfollowing is our consolidated lists pertaining to these two issues.\\nCommon reasons why establishments will not participate:\\nI Owners are anti-smoking, want to avoid the issue and do not want to encourage smoking.\\nThey think that by accommodating smokers, they are alienating the non-smokers\\n2. Owners have already made a conscious decision to go no-smoking and see no need for\\naccommodation.\\n3. Restaurant is too small for different smoking sections and does not have the ability to\\naccommodate.\\n2045520098\\n4. Owners do not want their establishments to have any association with Philip Morris Inc\\nand/or any other tobacco companies. They would rather avoid the entire smoking issue rather\\nthan associate with a program related to smoking.\\n5. Language bamer between the establishment personnel and the sales promotion\\nrepresentatives Many non-English speaking establishments do not understand or feel\\ncomfortable with the program's entirely English materials. This problem occurs primarily in\\nMiami, San Antonio and E: Paso.\\nCommon reasons why establishments will not sign:\\n1. Owners fear that there is a future payment and that there is a \"catch\" to this program.\\n2. Proprietors do not have the authority to approve any advertising because decisions regarding,\\nany printing of the establishment's name need to be made at a corporate level. We are\\ncreating a list of these restaurants/crains.\\n3. Owners do not want the direct association with Philip Morris Inc. and/or any other tobacco\\ncompanies that would result from print advertising.\\n4 Establishments want more control over advertising--ability to create or proof ads.",

The conference\\nwas attended by representatives of several major manufacturing companies active in the\\nbusiness reengineering arena, including RJR.\\nI learned the a few things before the RJR representative (Vic Walsh) figured out where I\\nworked:\\nWHERE THEY ARE TODAY\\n• RJR makes 675 \"brand styles\"\\n• R&D is responsible for specifications. They reside on the host computer and are\\ndownloaded from the host directly to the plants.\\n• RJR's scheduling system is a \"hybrid\" (custom code) which was developed in 1979. In\\n1980, they decided to put the schedule and computers on the production floor, and train\\ntheir operators to use them. Each module has a computer workstation and its own\\nproduction schedule.\\n• Long Range Production Planning is done in weekly buckets by a central organization. It\\nis based on \"Family Group\" (possibly equivalent to size group) level scheduling until\\n\"ready to run\". Once \"ready to run\", 3 to 4 weeks in advance of production, the schedule\\nis downloaded to the plants, who then own the schedule.\\n• Distribution gives SKU requests directly to the plants.\\nThey typically require 2 to 3 weeks lead time for materials. (Having an in-\\nhouse supplier in RJR Archer probably helps)\\n⚫ They run \"standard product\" unless told otherwise by distribution.\\n⚫ 10 minutes before a run is to end, materials are electronically called for from\\n'\\nthe hi-rise storage system.\\nOperators are allowed to intercede in the schedule for their module as long as materials\\nare on hand.\\n• RJR has a minimum inventory policy. No details on this.\\n2051246855",

The agency received hundreds of thousands\\nof comments, a majority of which opposed the FDA's proposed regulations.\\nToday in Washington, we at Philip Morris joined The Tobacco Institute and\\nother members of the tobacco industry at a news conference, during which we\\nmade public our comments to the FDA.\\nSpeaking on behalf of the industry, I restated the industry's commitment to\\npreventing minors from having access to cigarettes. I also outlined the\\nnumerous reasons why we believe the FDA's plan to regulate cigarettes is\\nillegal and excessive. \"The FDA's proposal is not really about preventing youth\\nsmoking. FDA seeks to ban common promotional practices and impose\\nrequirements that would interfere with adults' choices and the rights of cigarette\\ncompanies to sell a legal product.\" A complete copy of my remarks from today's\\nnews conference is attached.\\nI would like to express senior management's heartfelt thanks to each of you who\\ntook the time to contact the FDA on this most important issue. A special thank\\nyou to those who went the extra mile by asking friends, family members and\\nbusiness contacts to take action. The FDA is required by law to catalogue and\\nevaluate each and every letter received.\\nWe will pursue efforts in the courts to prevent the FDA from seizing regulatory\\ncontrol of our products. We will keep you informed as developments occur, and\\nwill also continue to let you know how you can most effectively help to oppose\\nthe FDA's plan.\\nThank you again, and happy New Year to all.\\nattachment\\n2056276656",

Winokur\\nRE:\\nDraft ETS Communications Resource Book\\nDATE: September 25, 1996\\nI have enclosed a revised edition of the Message Point section of the draft ETS\\nCommunications Resource Book. Given all of the edits to both the first and\\nsecond drafts which have been requested, it seemed only fair to try to\\nincorporate those comuments and others provided subsequently and offer you an\\namended version, harmonizing all the recommendations, for your consideration.\\nWherever possible the revised edition adheres to the spirit and letter of the\\noriginal. Following are some of the structural changes:\\n• A new opening \"Overview\" sequence of messages is suggested using those\\nalready cited throughout the document. These are placed at the beginning to\\noffer top line messages which may be supported in subsequent sections.\\n⚫ References to exposure study research has been moved up to the Overview\\nsection as have the other arguments which seem related to the underlying\\nweaknesses of the ETS science. You'll note that references to \"personal\\nmonitoring studies\" have been deleted. It seems a technical point to explain how\\nthe actual exposure data are obtained, and a white paper is available elsewhere\\nin the binder to elaborate.\\n• The section on respiratory effects has been consolidated, providing one for\\nalleged effects on adults and another for alleged effects on children. And the\\nasthma arguments which were previously a third section are now placed under\\nthe adult and children sections.\\n⚫ The original Science and Public Policy section remains unchanged. But an\\nalternative version is suggested at the conclusion. The title suggests a discussion\\nabout the broader issue of how science in general, not just ETS, and public policy\\ninteract rather than further discussion about how ETS science should be\\nevaluared more carefully by scientists and policy makers. The former is the\\nbigger debate and, because of it, we have the opportunity to position ETS in the\\ncontext of a larger issue to due with sound science, reversals in scientific opinion\\nand unnecessary regulation.\\n2073620583",

Slavitt\\nKaren Chaikin/YSP\\nChristine Mohrmann/Issues Management\\nDATE: August 3, 1999\\nTobacco Retailer Responsibility Initiative - Final Report\\nAttached is Preventing Teenage Access to Tobacco, the final report presented to the\\nAttorneys General of the Tobacco Retailer Responsibility Initiative (TRRI) -- a project\\nendorsed by the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG).\\nTRRI's mission is to provide assistance to AGs in proactive measures to prevent the sale of\\ntobacco products to miners. It's focus has been the application of consumer protection\\nauthority as a tool to prevent tobacco sales to minors.\\nThe report provides historical background, activities on tobacco-related issues, and\\nsuggested activities for AGs, most of which we have already heard about.\\nFollowing is a brief review of chapters 3-7 and a list of Appendices:\\nApplication of Consumer Protection Authority. Recommends the use of consumer\\nprotection laws as a means to enforce violations of the minimum age sales law. In addition to\\nthese laws providing greater penalties than the state sales to minors law, it allows AGs to\\naddress the responsibility of the storeowner rather than the actions of one individual sales\\nclerk. The report describes the expansion of the application of this authority since it was\\nstarted in 1987 with a private action, Kyte v. Store 24, followed by actions in Massachusetts\\n(1994 and 1995); Kansas (1996); New York/Massachusetts/Vermont (1998) (ie., Assurances\\nof Discontinuance); and promulgation of rules by the Massachusetts AG (1998).\\nEnforcement Issues: Building Alliances in Tobacco Enforcement Suggests that AGs\\nform alliances with government agencies, the public health sector, and the FDA to participate\\nin tobacco enforcement efforts. These alliances would be especially helpful in those states\\nthat do not enforce the law in conjunction with illegal sales detected during Synar and FDA\\ninspections. Additionally, AGs may be able to use the results of FDA and Synar Inspections\\nto bring consumer protection actions when sales to minors meet certain criteria of state\\nstatutes or rules. The report also notes that the MSA would appear to provide AGS with the\\nresources to initiate these actions against retailers when it can be documented through\\ninspections.\\n2074880379",

Bible\\nEarlier this week, we discovered that an ingredient supplied by\\nCelanese which is used in the manufacture of filter material was contaminated with\\na bacteria. The manufactured product containing this material gave\\noff an\\nunpleasant odor, which is how we detected the problem initially. We immediately\\nceased production, cleaned out the tanks and pipes containing the material, and did\\nnot resume production until a substitute material was obtained from another\\nvendor. We also put a hold on all of the affected product that was within our\\ncontrol.\\nOngoing testing revealed that the presence of the bacteria triggered a\\nchain reaction which led to the formation of a byproduct by the name of methyl\\nisothiocyanate (MITC), a toxic substance. MITC can cause various forms of\\ndiscomfort, including eye, nose and throat irritation, dizziness, coughing, and\\nwheezing, if inhaled in sufficient quantities.\\nWe have no evidence that any of the affected product reached the retail\\ndistribution channel. However, it is possible that some of it did, and we cannot\\neasily or quickly verify that fact. Accordingly, because we are dealing with a toxic\\nsubstance, we decided out of an abundance of caution to institute a nationwide\\nconsumer recall. As a result, we are recalling in the U.S. domestic market every\\npack of cigarettes, both at retail and wholesale, of all of the brands shown on the\\nattached list. That recall was launched at 3:00 p.m., which is within one day of our\\nbecoming aware of the scope of the problem. A copy of the press release announcing\\nthe recall is attached.

The\\n\"Formula 1 of the Sea\" concept is, in my view, a logical and\\nappropriate extension of the current promotion-driven brand\\ncommunication in Italy for several reasons.\\nFirst, it builds on an existing sailing-related brand image\\nand focuses on the specialized area of maxi yachts, the\\n\"Formula 1 of the Sea\". Given the tremendous popularity and\\nunderstanding, and extensive media coverage of competitive\\nsailing in Europe, this campaign associates Merit with the\\ndimension of sailing that most spectators are interested in;\\nthe high action, technology, challenge and risk.\\nSecond, in the context of the legal media and creative\\nrestrictions in several European markets, this campaign\\nseems to work best without light-up and smoking shots; high\\naction and smoking are often not compatible.\\nThirdly, through its high energy/high action execution, the\\ncampaign communicates \"flavor\", rather than lightness.\\nAssuming that Merit already has a firm reputation as a low\\ntar brand, this change in communication may widen the\\nbrand's appeal, especially among younger male smokers.\\n- 1 -\\n2504040564",

Striegel\\nSUBJECT:\\nFebruary 21, 1992\\nProgress Report on Capillary GC/FID and GC/NPD Organic\\nGas Phase Analysis (PROJECT B 470, GPSA)\\nProject Review\\nMethod development on gas phase analysis began with the purchase\\nof the Varian 3600 multiple detector gas chromatograph in November\\nof 1988. A 60 meter DBWAX column was initially used and evaluated\\nwith injections of gas phase components. A six port valve was\\ninstalled on the Varian GC in March of 1989 for introducing gas\\nphase smoke to the column via a sampling loop and a portable\\nsmoking machine. With the installation of a liquid nitrogen valve\\nfor oven cryogenic cooling a 30 meter DB5 capillary column was\\ninstalled (1). A splitter wag connected at the end of the column\\ndividing the column effluent to both the FID and NPD detectors.\\nThe output signal from the FID and NPD detectors was linked to the\\nDec system using the Nelson software in September 1989. Various\\ncolumns and combination of column were tested to improve separa-\\ntion and resolution. In December of 1989 a 100 meter X 0.25 mm X\\n0.5 μm was purchased form Supelco and installed initially on the\\nFinnigan 1050 GC/MS and used for gas phase component identifi-\\ncation. Early in 1990 the Petrocol column was installed on the\\nVarian 3600 (2). A Borgwaldt RM 1/G single port smoker was\\npurchased and installed in March of 1990. The fifth puff was\\ninitially selected for analysis, later the puff selected was\\nmodified to be the next puff after the burnline passed a point\\n35mm from the tipping paper.\\nGas Phase Development for 1992\\nIn conversations with Jim Bell and Dr. Vello Norman it was\\nsuggested that a method for collecting and analyzing all the puffs\\nwould give more representative data. A twenty port Borwaldt RM\\n20/CS smoking machine was purchased by Jim Bell's group and loaned\\nto Analytical Development in October of 1991.\\nDevelopment of this method is now being pursued. The Borgwaldt RM\\n20/CS puffer is loaded with the number of cigarettes equal to the\\nnumber of puffs in a particular Brand. As each selected puff is\\ntaken it is collected in a 500Ml gas syringe modified by Dave\\nSmart of the Glass shop. The cigarettes are lit one minute apart\\n87298643",

The amendment would ban smoking in the Federal\\nworkplace except in \"separately ventilated\" areas. The amendment is the same as S. 262\\n(enclosed) except for (1) the deletion of the provision establishing an Environmental\\nTobacco Smoke Advisory Office at EPA (p. 12) and (2) the addition of an exemption for\\nVA hospitals.\\nOnly Senators Ford and Lautenberg spoke on the Senate floor. Other Senators\\nsubmitted statements for the record. (The Congressional Record of the debate will be\\nforwarded as soon as it is available.) Senator Ford's remarks focussed on the experience\\nof the airlines where air quality has declined over the years since the airline smoking ban\\nwas enacted.\\nImmediately afterwards the Senate passed, by voice vote, a Bingaman Amendment\\nbanning, in Federal buildings, the sale of tobacco products in vending machines and the\\ndistribution of free samples of tobacco products, except in areas where minors are\\nprohibited. Bingaman's amendment is essentially the same as his bill, S. 673 (enclosed)\\nintroduced in March.\\nLast year Senator Lautenberg offered his \"PRO-KIDS\" amendment to the Labor-HHS-\\nEducation Bill.

This assumption is based upon the expectation that the findings\\nof the \"Expert Advisory Commitee\" of the Surgeon General will be either:\\n(3) Condemnatory to tobacco use. (This will require research as a\\nnecessity for defense end meintenance of existence.)\\n(b) Inconclusive, expressing a hazard by statistical inference even\\nthough lacking in clinical and laboratory proof.
