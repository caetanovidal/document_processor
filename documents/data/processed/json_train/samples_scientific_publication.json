Of the 2 major subfractions, the \"methanol-\\ninsoluble neutrals (MIN) were much more active than the \"methanol-\\nsoluble\" neutrals (MSN). Distribution of MSN between nitromethane and\\ncarbon disulfide yielded 2 active fractions. Poor dose-response effects\\nsuggest that extraneous materials may reduce the activity of MSN. Analysis\\nof the recovery of MSN is difficult, but apparently there were significant\\nlosses during separation. On countercurrent distribution (CCD), MIN\\nyielded 3 active and 2 inactive subfractions. Recovery of the activity of\\nMIN in the subfractions was excellent in comparison with an earlier separa-\\ntion with silicic acid chromotography. Recoveries might be improved if\\nCCD is applied to the NF before the more rigorous chromatographic separa-\\ntions.

With this procedure, tumor-promot-\\ning agents as well as complete carcinogens were\\ndetected. All the subfractions were recombined in\\nproportion to their yield, to provide a reconstituted\\nsample that would have been identical with NF if\\nno changes had occurred during the separation\\nprocedure. The biological activity of this recon-\\nstituted material, however, was substantially less\\nthan that of NF, suggesting that important amounts\\nof the active materials were lost during chroma-\\ntography.

The idea\\nof tipping perforation is rather old and there is a\\nBritish patent issued in the neighborhood of 1890 that\\ncovers this principle. Nevertheless, there have been\\nvery few publications that deal with the investigation.\\nof this system.

Jenkins, Jr., Roger T. Bass, Richard H. Newman and Marie K. Chevis\\nPhilip Morris Research Center, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nJu a recent report, recommendations for the standard-\\nized preparation of sachon-14 labelled cigarette were\\nmade (b). I was shown that the error generated in\\nuniformly placing the radioactive label axially within\\ntite rod is also the degree of error reflected in the radio-\\nactivity recovered from total smoke. Cigarettes with large\\nvariations in the axial placement of the label would\\nrequire the snicking of a large number of such cigarettes\\nto determine the total smoke distribution. The data thus\\ngenerated are reflective of the average values, but with\\na large experimental error. The more uniformly labelled\\nthe cigarette, the smaller the error in the total smoke\\ndistribution.\\nWhen the radioactivity is not uniformly distributed\\nradially within the cigarette, the smoking of a large\\ncumber of cigarettes might not overcome any bias\\nimparted to the data. Egerton (2). Kerch (3), Wakeham\\n(4) and Osdene (5) have all theorized about the effeur\\nof the periphery on naincream smoke formation. To\\ndate, there is very little experimental evidence to sup_\\nport these hypotheses. In order to empirically certai\\nthe importance of the tobacco periphery to smoke for\\nmation, carbon-14 labelled cigarettes have heen prepared\\nwith uniform and non-uniforas radial labelling. Effects\\nof radial positioning on the total smoke distributions\\nwoce meatared.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nPreparation of Labelled Cigarettes\\nThe carbon-14 fabelled cigarettes were fabricated by\\nthe procedures recommended for the standardized pre-\\nparation of labelled cigarettes (1). The cigarettes were\\nprepared by chree basic incorporation methods:\\n1 Syringe-Spiking: This procedure was used to add the\\nlabelled compounds primarily to the central portion of\\nthe carette rad (1)\\n2. Spraying: This procedure was employed when solu-\\nbility permitted, and produced cigarette filler uniformly\\nlabelled with the carbon 14 compounds. Cigarettes were\\nther handmade as previously described (B).\\nPresented, in part, at the 27th Tobacco Chemie Krict Holecense\\nanton-Salem, North Carolina, USA., in Oteber 1971\\nRecrived!

The labelled\\nsheet materials were then either uniformly blended inso\\nnormal University of Kentucky I reference tiller or\\nwere added at discrete radial positions within the cigar\\nrette rod (1).\\nRadiochemicals\\nDotriacontane-16.17-C was purchased from Mal-\\nhuckrodt Nuclear and proline-C (0) from New Eng-\\nland Nuclear. Nicorine C (U) and cellulose C (1)\\nwere obtained from biosynthesized Brighe tobacco-C\\n(U) (6). Invere sugar (U) was prepared by the treas-\\nment of glucose-C (U) (New Baggland Nuclear) with\\ninvertase. Radiochemical purities in all cases were better\\nthan 95% before application.\\nRadioactivity Determinations\\nAppropriate aliquors of the extracted or combusted\\nsamples were counted in a Packard Model 3394 scintil\\nlation spectrometer (Packard lostrument Company) with\\noptimized gain and window settings.

ROGERS, D.Sc.\\nUnit of Human Morphology\\nThe Medical School\\nThe Flinders University of South Australia\\nBedford Park, South Australia\\nABSTRACT. Mucosal samples from the bifurcation of a\\nmajor bronchus were examined from 23 patients undergoing\\ndiagnostic bronchoscopy. Samples were autoradiographed\\nusing a technique that avoids any contact between tissue\\nand reagents until the end of autoradiographic exposure.\\nThe autoradiographs were scanned for a-particle tracks. No\\nsignificant level of a-activity was detected, even in samples\\nfrom heavy smokers who had continued to smoke within\\nseveral hours of the bronchoscopy. The fower limit of detec-\\ntion of a-activity in this experiment was equivalent to about\\n55.5 becquerrels/kg (1,500 pCi/kg) Polonium-210. These\\nresults do not support the hypothesis presented by others.\\nthat a radioactivity in particulate material of cigarette\\nsmoke contributes significantly to the association between.\\ncigarette-smoking and bronchial carcinoma.\\nTHE HYPOTHESIS, first advanced in the 1960s, that\\nradioactive constituents of cigarette smoke, lead-210\\n(210Pb) and polonium-210 (210 Po), may be the agents res-\\nponsible for carcinoma of the lung in smokers, has been\\nrecently revived by Martell. From his measurements of\\nthe properties and radioactive content of tobacco leaves\\nand smoke particles he concluded that, as well as volatile\\n210 Po, insoluble particles of high 210 Pb content are\\ninhaled and may be deposited in the bronchi of smokers,\\nwhere ingrowth of 210Po could lead to prolonged expos-\\nure to a-particles.

SPEIR, JR.,\\nMD, Augusta, Ga\\nABSTRACT: A number of new tests for detection of small airway disease have been developed in\\nthe past several years. It is hoped that these will prove valuable as screening tests to detect those at\\nrisk of developing obstructive airway disease. We obtained data on the degree of discrimination of\\nsingle breath nitrogen studies (CV/VG, COTLC, ANL), air-He studies (Vmax50), and the maximal\\nmidexpiratory flow (FEF) in detecting abnormalities in young smokers. Only the CV/VC and\\nCCTLC significandy separated smokers from nonsmokers, each revealing 20% abnormal values in\\nsmokers.\\n0000150841\\n(\\nI\\nCHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE AIRWAY DISEASE is a serious\\nhealth problem in the United States, and no one\\ndoubts that it is intimately associated with chronic\\ncigarette smoking. According to a 1972 NHLI Task\\nFonce report,' chronic respiratory diseases cost the\\npeople of these United States 6.3 billion dollars in\\n1967, and cost the lives of 126,102 persons. These\\nfures have surely escalated during the past ten years.\\nThe major portion of the economic and human cost of\\nthese diseases can be attributed to chronic obstructive\\niv disease.\\ntver since Anthonisen et al demonstrated\\npathophysiologic abnormalities in bronchitic patients\\nwith normal routine lung function tests, the literature\\nhas been rite with speculation concerning path-\\nphysiologic mechanisms by which disease in the \"si-\\nlent peripheral airways (<2 mm in diameter) might\\nprecede and proceed to irreversible airway obstruc-\\ntion. Many tests have been developed, such as those we\\nhave used in this study, which are purported to dem-\\nonstrate small airway dysfunction. It is hoped that\\nthese newly developed tests of small airway function\\n(SATs) will detect chronic obstructive airway disease at\\nan early, asymptomatic, and potentially reversible\\nstage. However, as Burrows and Hasan' state in their\\nrecent review, we are not at all certain that the tests we\\ne correlate with small airway dysfunction, nor do we\\nknow that small airway disease or dysfunction ulú-\\nmately leads to chronic airway obstruction. Nonethe-\\nles, the magnitude of the pulmonary disease problem\\ncaused by cigarette smoking compels us to establish or\\ndisprove the present hypotheses.\\nRead before the Section on Chest Diseases, Southern Medical Association,\\n* Annual Somufic Assembly, Dallas, Tex, Nov 6-9, 1977,\\nFrom the Section of Pulmonary Discases, Department of Medicine.

Niewoehner et alf studied at autopsy the\\nlungs of young smokers (aged 25.7 ± 1.2 years), all\\naccident victims, and compared them to nonsmokers\\nof the same age. Respiratory bronchiolitis associated\\nwith clusters of pigmented alveolar macrophages was\\nobserved in the peripheral airways of all smokers, but\\nwas only rarely noted in the nonsmokers. In a classic\\npaper, Ingram and O'Cain' denionstrated frequency\\ndependence of dynamic compliance in a majority of\\ncigarette smokers, and showed that it disappeared\\nafter cessation of smoking. As Dosman and Macklem\\npointed out in their review, the prevalence of abnor-\\nnalities in this and other tests of small airway dysfunc-\\ntion in smokers has averaged 50% or higher. It is\\nobvious that 50% or more of smokers do not develop\\nchronic obstructive airway disease.\\nMost large-scale studies have assessed a heterogen-\\nous group of smokers and nonsmokers, which in-\\ncluded persons spanning the age range from the sec-\\nond to ninth decade. Many of these studies are difficult\\nto assess, not only because of the broad age ranges, but\\nbecause of the wide differences in smoking habits and\\nsymptoms in the study population. There has been\\nconsiderable intersubject and intrasubject variabil-\\nity. In an attempt to clarify this situation we re-\\nstricted our studies to a group of young (21 to 35 years\\nof age) healthy, nonasthmatic persons.

A resting blood sample was taken\\nduring the physical examination for determination of\\ncarboxyhemoglobin levels and confirmation of the classi\\nfication of the subject as a smoker or nonsmoker. Table 1\\npresents mean data on age, height, weight, and resting\\ncarboxyhemoglobin levels of the subjects as well as the\\nclinical spirometric evaluation of the two groups. Exposures\\nto the four ambient pollutant conditions were assigned\\nrandomly in a double-blind experimental design. All\\nstudies were conducted in a temperature-regulated room)\\nat 25 ± 0.5°C and 202% relative humidity. The con\\nditions of exposure were a) filtered air (FA), b) 50 ppm\\ncarbon monoxide in filtered air (CO), c) 0.27 ppm per\\noxyacetyl nitrate in filtered air (PAN), and d) 50 ppm car-\\nbon monoxide and 0.27 ppm peroxyacetyl nitrate in filtered.\\nair (PANCO).\\nMaximal oxygen uptake was determined by a modified.\\ntreadmill Balke test (8) which required a 1% per min\\nprogressive increase in grade while walking at 93 m/min\\nuntil the subject could no longer continue. The work was\\npreceded by a 5-min sitting rest and followed by a 15-min\\nsitting recovery for determination of oxygen debt. Pollutant\\ngases were mixed with filtered air outside the environ-\\nmental chamber by use of calibrated rotometers (Gilmont)\\nand a \"Pitor\" tube calibrated against a dry gasineter\\n(Parkinson-Cowan). The mixtures were fed into the in-\\nspired side of a mouthpiece via thoroughly cleaned Pyrex\\nglass tubing to prevent breakdown of PAN. Inspired con-\\ncentrations of the pollutants were checked twice during\\neach experimental session to insure that mixing was occur-\\nring as designed during the progressive increase in exercise\\n1000278834",

We believe that some of the state-\\nments made by Clarence Cook Little,\\nSc.D., do not measure up to the high\\nscientific standards he sets in the opening\\nchapter of his report. And we are ap.\\npalled by what the lay press has done\\nwith cautious and unexceptionable re-\\nmarks.\\nDr. Little reviews the experimental\\nstudies supported by the Council's grants\\ntesting whether \"tobacco smoke might\\nhave activity as a direct-contact car-\\ncinogen.\"\\nHe concludes: \"The over-all impres\\nsion gained from these many bioassay\\nstudies is that tobacco smoke LS in-\\nactive or of extremely minute activity\\nin these several artificial systems, none of\\nwhich of course actually measures hu-\\nman response under realistic conditions.\\nThe results lend little to support the hy-\\npothesis that cigarette smoke can act as\\na direct-contact carcinogen in the human\\nlung. Study is continuing with respect to\\nother hypothetical modes of action.\"\\nThe experimental systems used for\\nbioassay of tobacco smoke and its con-\\ndensates are indeed artificial, and one is\\nsurely entitled to question their support\\nof a hypothesis that cigarette smoke can\\nact as a direct-contact carcinogen in the\\nhuman lung.\" The newspaper headlines,\\nsuch as \"Smokers Assured in Industry\\nStudy\" or \"Report by Tobacco Council\\nFinds No Cigarette Link to Cancer.\" and\\nthe stories that \"scientists... found 'little\\nto support, the charge that cigarette.\\nsmoke produces cancer\" are a far cry\\nfrom Dr. Little's careful statement\\nHe does, however, state: \"Lung can-\\ncer is a rare disease.\" Well, how rare is\\nrare? Cancer as an entity is the second\\ncause of death in this country. In 1962.\\ndeaths attributed to all cancer causes\\ntotaled 278,562. In that same year,\\ndeaths from lung cancer numbered\\n41,376. A very rapid calculation shows\\nthat one out of seven cancer deaths was\\ndue to lung cancer. Is this rare?\\nDr. Little also makes much of the fol-\\nlowing: \"Although the actual number of\\ndeaths from lung cancer is increasing be-\\ncause of population growth and because\\nof larger numbers of persons in the high\\nage groups, the rate of increase in the\\nage-corrected death rate has been slowing\\ndown since 1930. This declining rate of\\nincrease, viewed in the light of actual\\nand per capita consumption of cigarettes\\nduring this period, raises a serious ques\\ntion concerning the validity of the simple\\ncausation theory and demonstrates the\\nneed for continued study and observation.\"\\nThere was about a ninefold increase in\\nthe age-adjusted mortality for cancer\\nof the lung between 1930 and 1960. A\\ncasual glance at tables of vital statistics\\nsuggests that if the reported rate of in-\\ncrcase between 1930 and 1935 had con-\\ntinued as such for the next 25 years, then\\nthe mortality for cancer of the lung\\nin 1960 would have been about 11 or 12\\ntimes that of 1930. Dr. Little seems to be\\nsaying that this \"rare disease,\" which has\\ndemonstrated a remarkable increase in\\nmortality, ought to be increasing even\\nmore rapidly if there is any simple cau-\\nsality relationship to cigarette smoking.\\nWhy this should be so is quite unclear.\\nWe do not believe that Dr. Little's re-\\nport is in any way reassuring to smokers.\\nIt does not invalidate the conclusions\\nreached by the Surgeon General's Advis\\nory Committee. The committee said.\\n\"Cigarette smoking is causally related to\\nlung cancer in men: the magnitude of the\\neffect of cigarette smoking far outweighs\\nall other factors.\"\\n1003043134",

Smoke from\\ncigarettes made from a flue-cured tobacco (T2) was more toxic and elicited cancers\\n'more quickly than that from cigarettes made from air-dried tobacco (T3) from the\\nsame crop. Filtered smoke air from T2 and unfiltered smoke gave similar yields of lung\\ntumours.\\nC57B! mice subjected to breathing a mixture\\nof cigarette smoke and air at regular intervals for\\nmost of their lives developed a low incidence (4%)\\nof alveologenic carcinomas of the lung (Harris\\nand Negroni, 1966, 1967). A control group of\\nsimilar size (200) did not develop any lung\\ntumours. Sequential infection of another, farger\\ngroup with four strains of influenza virus (mouse-\\nadapted, but immunologically distinct) yielded\\n2% alveologenic carcinomas in the survivors\\n(682) of the ensuing pneumonia. Many of these\\n\"smoke\" or \"flu\" tumours were transplantable\\nin isologous mice and grew like malignant\\ntumours, maintaining the histological structure\\nof the primary growth (Harris and Negroni,\\n1967).

Although these viruses were serologically\\nidentical by competition ways for proteins gp71 and p30, they\\nwere readily distinguishable in competition assays for proteins\\np15 and pt2 Two isolates of tropic viruses had p12s serolog\\nically distinguishable from AKR murine leukemia virus pt,\\nwhile two Buopic isolates had distinctly different pis. The\\nHaller ples were serologically indistinguishable from the plå\\npurified from the B-tropic radiatics leukemia virus (RadLVY\\nVI. Moreover, this pl was indistinguishable fain the p12\\nof the endogenous C57BL/Ka xenotropie virus. Similarly, the\\np15 of the B-tropic viruses were secologically distinel from the\\nARR murkie ukercla vins type of pts, as was the pls of one\\nC57BL Ntropic virus, while another N-tropic isolate had a pl5\\nidentical to the AKR murine leukemia virus p15. These results\\nare interpreted to suggest that the endogenous N-tropic virus\\nof C570L micr undergoes recombination with the endogenous,\\nscootrople virus and that this mechanism is involved in the\\ncarnation of Bropic viruses in C57BL mice.\\nVarious strains of mice have been shown to genetically transmit\\necotropic Clype viruses (1-4). Although the site of virus Inte\\ngration may vary among mouse strains (2, 4), these viruses are\\nvery similar by hybridization und serological assays (5, 6).\\nHowever, among the ecotrople viruses isolated from mice, two\\nclasses, N and B-trople, can be readily distinguished by host\\nrestriction for rep.\\nrange characterization 7.

Fontana\\nDepartment of Pediatries, New York University Medicel\\nCenter, College of Medicine, Hew York, N. T.\\nIn the past thirty years, particularly in the last several years, the possibility\\nthat tobacco or its products might be a cause of disease has been briskly dis-\\nased. The questions of whether allergy to tobacco does occur and, if it\\ndoes, of how intimately it is associated with recognizable peripheral vascular\\nsymptoms, remain to be answered. The investigations of Sulzberger and the\\nreports of Harkavy d of, about 30 years ago, were the first to indicate that a\\nsensitivity reaction to tobacco might be responsible for certain vascular dis-\\neases, especially thremboangiitis obliterans. On the other hand, reports by\\nTrasoff et al., Chabot,' and Westcott and Wright failed to confirm the con-\\ntention that the skin reaction produced by tobacco extract was a specific re-\\nsponse designating a sensitization process of the blood vessels\\nThese divergent views and findings by competent investigators in the field\\ndemanded a reappraisal of the sensitizing potential of the allergen, tobacco, on\\nthe buman vascular system and ascertainment of the true incidence and signifi-\\ncance of the positive intradermal reaction to tobacco extract. Many of the\\nthoughts expressed in this report are based on a study of more than 1000 vol-\\nunteers, including adults and children, tested with 5 different tobacco extracts.\\nApproximately 5000 intradermal reactions to tobacco extract were observed\\nand studied in relation to personal allergy, familial allergy, symptoms related\\nto tobacco smoking, penpheral vascular symptoms and, finally, plethysmo-\\ngraphic measurements of blood flow to the tower extremities and automatic\\nreading of surface temperature.\\nWhile the observations of Salzberger, Harkavy, and others have verified\\nthe immunologic specificity of the skin reaction to tobacco, the clinical signifi\\ncance of the positive skin test is not always obvious. It must be admitted\\nthat certain difficulties are encountered in using any type of skin test as a\\nmeans of diagnosis. The more important factors that must be considered in\\nevaluating positive intradermal reaction include the preparation and relia-\\nbility of the extracts, the method of testing, the importance of the reaction in\\na single individual, and the correlation of the positive skin reaction to the\\nallergen with the patient's symptomatology. The tobacco extracts used in\\nthis study have been prepared by workers experienced in this field. Care was\\ntaken in the performance of the intradermal test and in the interpretation of\\nthe results in order to reduce to a minimum the possibility of nonspecific false\\npositive reactions and other results of experimental error.\\nBefore presenting the results of this investigation, I shall state some funda-\\nmental immunologie concepts that prompted my belief that certain tobecco\\neffects are based on a specific allergic susceptibility of particular individuals,\\nrather than on toxic produces in the tobacco smoke.\\nIt b known that most forms of allergy affecting diferent parts of the body\\ncan be verified in many instances by observations of the skin after introduction\\nof the allergen respon:ible for the disease.

To\\ndetermine if reductions are rebated to decreases in hepatic\\nORNAS, we performed bloring analysis of total liver RNA\\nwith rat apo R, apo E, and albumin cDNA probes. The expected\\nreduction in albumin mRNA level to 48% of control livers\\noccurred in diabetic rat Uver, while apo B and apo E mRNA\\nlevels were unchanged. The proportiop of translational stop\\ncodoo (BSTOP) ¤RNA averaged 43% of total in diabetic rats\\nsimilar to control levels. Long-term labeling experiments using\\nSmethionine in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and spe\\ncific immunoprecipitatious demonstrated production of apo B\\nand apo F. and albumin by hepatocytes from diaberic rats was\\nreduced to 37%, 53%, and 23% of controls. Pulse-chase studies,\\ntogether with mRNA unolyses, suggest that reduced hepatic\\nsecretion of apo B and apo E in diabetics is primarily a result of\\nimpaired translation and not intracellular degradation. Ribo-\\nsome transit studies directly confirmed the prolonged elonga-\\ntion rates for apo B and apo E mRNAs in hepatocytes derived\\nfrom diabetic rata. This effect was more pronounced on apo Bi\\n(higher molecular weight than on apo B. lower molecular\\nweight).

Lymphosarcoma appeared in 16 females and\\n13 mates. The inheritance indicated an autosomal recessive gene con-\\nfening susceptibility to lymphosarcoma. We designated this gene is. Our\\ndata were compatible with both concepts of genetic susceptibility to lympho-\\nsarcoma and vertical transmission of a virus. Affected rabbits usually died\\nbetween the ages of 5 and 13 months. The neoplastic involvement of\\nlymphoreticular organs and other organs, especially kidneys, corresponded\\nto a pattem observed in lymphosarcoma of other domestic animals. Specifico!-\\nly, it resembled in many ways visceral lymphosarcomatosis of cats which\\nhas been proved unequivocally to be caused by feline leukemia vires.\\nThis similarity between rabbit and cat lymphosarcomas involved both sites\\nof onset and distribution of the neoplastic lesions and the hematologic\\nAndings of a predominantly aleukemic picture.

Excessive secretion of either hormone may follow one\\nof the pathological changes. One is hyperplasia, induced in\\nthe case of hypercortisolism by high levels of pituitary adre-\\naocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or rarely by ACTH-se-\\ncreting carcinoma of bronchus or other tissue. The stimules\\nfor hyperplasia in aldosteronism has not been identified. The\\nother pathological change is the development of an adrenal\\ncortical tunce or tumon, usually a single benign adenoma,\\nsometimes aulignant, and occasionally ectopic. Tumor of\\none sort or another is the commonest ause of adrenal hyper-\\nfunction, and it must be searched for in all cases. Because it\\nmay reside in either left or right adrenal, or infrequently in\\nboth, each must be investigated.\\nEarly strecapts localization were made with rocatgeno-\\ngraphic examination of the abdomen, following retroper\\nitoneal injection first of air and later of oxygen or carbon\\ndioxide. Mochi better results ate now obtained, and with\\ngreater safely, with philebography and arteringrophy. These\\ncaethods, however, have their drawbacks. Preoperative med.\\nJAMA, July 3, 1972 Vol 221, No 1\\nication is often required; catheterization of vessels must be\\nperformed by a team of skilled operators; occasionally rup\\nture and hemorrhage of the small veins and arteries of the\\nadrenal occur; and there is danger of serious reactions to\\nthe contrast medium.\\nA promising improvement has recently been reportert in\\na series of papers from the University of Michigan Medical\\nCenter. Following the demonstration in dogs that intra-\\nvenously injected 19-iodocholesterol tagged with iodine 131\\n(NM-145) was concentrated sufficiently in the adrenals to\\npermait scanning), the procedure was employed successfully\\nin the study of a patient with Cushing's syndrome. With\\nuse of 2 milliceries of NM-145, excellent visualization of\\nthe adreals, obtained with a rectilinear photoscanner and\\nan Anger camera, showed that both glands concentrated the\\nisotope equally, thus allowing the diagnosis of hyperplasia\\nand the absence of tumor. In a later publication\" too similar\\ncases are reported, together with two other cases of Cumbing's\\nsyndrome that are of interest. In one, an adrenocortical tumor\\nwas identified in the right gland with total suppression of\\nuptake in the left; and in the other case, with symptoms per-\\nsisting after total adrenalectomy, the NM-145 study dis\\nclosed a remnant of adrenal tissue that had been missed at\\noperation. An elaborate extension of this method has been\\nused to measure adrenal function in patients without adrenal\\ndisease and in those with Cushing's syndrome.\"\\nIn the March 1972 mumber of the Archives of Internal\\nMedicine the Michigan group reports the successful use of\\nNM-145 to visualize aldosteronomas in four cases and dif-\\nfuse hyperplasia in one patient with \"idiopathic\" aldoster-\\nonism, ie, without tumor.\\nThe tea, apparently without hazard, is performed with an\\nintravenous dose of about 2,000 microcuries of NM-14%\\nThe biological half-life is a little more than three days. Usual-\\nly, scanning has beca done at this interval, but not until five,\\nsix, or eight to ten days in the aldosterone shadies. In these,\\npreinjection treatment with Lugol's solution has been given\\nto block thyroidal uptake. The liver concentrates the isotope\\nmather avidly soon after administration but largely rids itself\\nin three days. Cells of the adrenal cortex and of cortical\\ntumors appear to be the site of uptake, for pheochromo\\ntomas have not been vinalized by this method.\\nThe early results of the Ann Arbor investigators in adrenal\\nscanning with NM-145 justify similar trails in other in-\\nstitutions\\nH.TR\\n1.

The dangers of excessive coffee\\ndrinking were well known to an older generation of doctors,\\napart from whatever it may edd to the risk of myocardial\\ninfarction. The exotic patterns of recent years in the misuse\\nand abuse of drugs bive drawn attention away from the\\nhomely and everyday.\\n* Greden, J. F., American Jagnal of Poystory, 1974, 132, 1009.\\n• Bomen Colaborare Drág Surveillance Profum, Lancer, 1972, Z. 1278.\\nLeeds Infirmary Blues\\nPlanning began in 1962 for the new university hospital and\\nmedical school at Leeds, and the project matured in the\\nIntermittent fashion characteristic of the N.H.S. building\\nprogramme. Inevitably, planning blight soon affected the old\\nGeneral Infirmary and the other smaller hospitals scheduled\\nfor demolition-there could be no justification for speeding\\nmoney on modernization or even major repairs with the new\\nbospital just around the corner; but saiŤ morale remained\\nbigh, since the project was making obvious progress. À vast\\narea of ground in centrel Leeds was cleared by demolition-the\\nlocal henseholders went raiber more willingly than à some-\\ntimes the case, since they recognized the need for a new\\nhospital; the urban motorway that crossed the site was buried\\nin a tunnel; building began on a big new “total energy™\\ngenerating station complex with an estimated final cost of\\nperly (5 million; and the new medical school began to rise\\nat the western end of the site. Finally on the insistence of the\\nDepartment of Health the adjacent Hospital for Women We\\ndemolished and its patients are now created in a converted\\ncountry house more than four miles from the city centre-and\\nagan the medical staff concerned were prepared to put up\\nwith the inconvenience and the decline in standards inevitable\\nfrom such a roove because building of the new hospital was\\ndue to start in April 1975.\\nThen the are fell. Implicit in the cuts in N.H.S. expenditure\\nlast year to cope with the national economic rises was a halt\\nto new hospital building. No matter that nearly £16 milion\\nhad already been spent on the medical school and the ground-\\nwork for the hospital project without providing a single new\\nbospital bed; the regional health authority has deaded the\\n297\\nhospital building must stop. So Leeds is left with a decaying,\\nsmoke-blackened Victorian relic for its university hospital,\\nsurrounded by acres of devastation with the new total energy\\nplant on the skyline as a constant reminder of what might have\\nbeen Medical staff who have put up with inconvenience for\\nyears (the department of chemical pathology does its work in\\nfour separate sets of cramped quarters scattered through the\\nInfirmary) can see no prospect of any relief. The gynae-\\neologists, in their temporary unit, are working in conditions\\nworse than those at the start of the N.H.S.\\nThe future of the Leeds Medical school is also seriously\\nthreatened by the decision to halt the project. Four years ago\\nthe school increased Its intake from 80 to 130, and there are\\nplans to increase the numbers further to 160 and finally to\\n216-but these estimates were based on the new university\\nbospital. Medical school places are needed urgently in\\nNorthern England-already short of doctors-and there is\\ngood evidence that medical graduates tend to take up practice\\nin the region in which they have been trained.\\nIt a cruel accident of timing that the belt should have\\ncome at the most critical stage in the rebuilding programme,\\nfor much of the capital invested will be tomilly wasted if the\\nnew hospital is not built. The obstetric and paediatric services,\\nwhich should have been boused in phase 1 of the new hospital,\\nwill suffer most acutely; but every department faces bleak\\nprospect. It is just not possible to stop a programme that das\\nbera moving for so long without specific alterative plans for\\nthe future. The old Infirmary has had only a few essential\\nmodifications in the last decade, and its decline has acquired\\na momentum of its own. Reversal of that process will take a\\ngreat deal of monty and effort-for if the orw hospital is\\npostponed indefinitely, how long is the old one to be expected\\nto function? Two years of menry? So for £16 million has\\nbeen sunk into the project; and the estimated cost of com-\\npleting all phases of the new hospital is £12 million, sprend\\nover four years. But medical services must be provided for the\\ncommunity, and it might well prove that completion of the\\nnew hospital will prove the best bargain in the long run.\\nA campaign to save the new hospital is being given entho\\nsinetic support locally and is backed by Member of Perisment\\nand the regional newspapers as well as the public. When\\nunpopular decisions have to be taken it is always easiest for\\nadministrators to interpret policy rigidly-even one special\\ncase opens the way for everyone else to argue with renewed\\nenthusiasm. Leeds is a special case, however; for if the new\\nhospital is aborted after a twelve year gestation the reaction\\nof disillusionment and resentment among doctors and other\\nN.H.S. staff will spread through the whole region. Morale,\\nlike clinical acumen, defines quantification bat its effects\\ncannot be ignored.\\nLean Times Ahead for\\nN.H.S. Finances\\nOne of the problems in discussing the finances of the N.H.S.\\nis that of establishing what its allocation of resources actually\\nis at any one time. In December, for example, Mrs. Bubara\\nCastle told the House of Commons that an extra £450\\nmillion had beca allocated to the N.H.S. \"to cover pay\\nincreases and increased costs.\" With Inflation running at about\\n20% a year, the difficulty is to discover to what extent such\\nextra funds simply come for the fall in the",

Ex-\\nperiments indicating that serum does not induce ex-\\npression of the cyfos proto-oncogene in senescent fibro.\\nblasts raised the issue of a potential central role for\\nc-fos in the phenotype of sustained growth arrest. This\\nwas directly tested by microinjection of oncogenic\\nc-Ha-ras protein into senescent fibroblasts. While res\\ninjection was found to induce marked nuclear e-fos ex-\\npression and functional AP-1 transcription activity, this\\ndid not lead to DNA synthesis. These results suggest\\nthat the senescence phenotype cannot be solely attrib-\\nuted to the absence of c-fos expression and that the\\nproliferative block in these cells is either independent\\nof AP-1 transcriptional activity, downstream of it, or\\ninvolves multiple molecular mechanisms.\\nESSENTIALLY al eukaryotic cells demonstrate a finite\\ncapacity for cell division when serially passaged in\\nvitro (layfick and Moorhead, 1961). This phenom⚫\\nenon, referred to as cellular senescence, is characterized by\\nmaintenance of viability and metabolism in the presence of\\nsustained cell cycle arrest (reviewed in Goldstein, 1990;\\nMcCormick and Campisi, 1991). Because cultured fibro-\\nblasts taken from young individuals are capable of a greater\\nnumber of population doublings than cells from older sub+\\njects, cellular senescence is considered to reflect and con-\\ntribute to the aging process of the organism.\\nRecent studies have addressed the molecular basis for e\\nblock to proliferation in senescent cells. Comparison of the\\nexpression of cell cycle dependent genes in early passage and\\nSenescent fibroblasts reveals that growth arrest in the loner\\noccurs near the GIS boundary of the cell cycle just before\\nthe onset of DNA synthesis (Ritting et al., 1986). Senescent\\nfibroblasts exhibit a highly amenuated growth response fol-\\nlowing addition of serum or a variety of purified growth fac\\ntors despite the presence of normal numbers of growth factor\\nreceptors (Goldstein and Shmookler Reis, 1985).\\nin presenescent fibroblasts rendered quiescent by serum\\ndeprivation, stimulation by mitogenic growth factors results\\nin the rapid expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and\\nc-myc, and an increased expression of c-ras, before the onset\\nof proliferation (Greenberg and Ziff, 1984; Muller et al.,\\n1984; Lu et al., 1989). Expression of all three genes has\\nbeen shown to be essential for the initiation of DNA synthes\\nsis (Holt et al., 1986; Heikkila et al., 1987; Mulcahy et al.,\\nAddress correspondence to Dr. Feraitison at Department of Medicine and\\nPharmacology Liversity of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093,\\n1985; Riabowol et al., 1988). Similar studies conducted\\nusing senescent human fibroblasts have shown that while\\nc-myc and c-ras are expressed in response to mitogen treat\\nment (Rinling et al., 1986), c-fos appears repressed as a re-\\nsult of a specific transcriptional block (Seshadri and Cam-\\npisi, 1990). On the basis of this observation, it has been\\nsuggested that an inherent mechanistic difference exists be-\\ntween the responses of presenescent and senescent cells to\\ntreatment with serum, and that the lack of c-for transcription\\nmay account for the failure of the latter to proliferate (Ġold-\\nstein, 1990; McCormick and Campisi, 1991). Evidence for\\na central role for c-fos in the senescent phenotype is thus in-\\ndirect and derived from the observation of a deficiency in ex-\\npression of the proto-oncogene in senescent cells. A more\\ndirect test of this hypothesis is therefore important.\\nHere, we describe an experimental approach which allows\\na direct assessment of the potential role of cos in the\\nproliferation of senescent fibroblasts. Through direct micro-\\ninjection of human Ha-ras oncogene protein (T-24 ras) into\\nsenescent human fibroblasts, we find that c-fos is rapidly ex-\\npressed. Moreover, by coinjection of a reporter gene con\\nstruct containing on AP-I regulated promoter, we deter-\\nmined that the c-fos protein expressed in these cells was\\nlikely to be active as the senescent cells injected with the ras\\nprotein efficiently expressed the AP-1 regulated reporter.\\ngene.

How-\\never, in contrast to retroviral one genes, mutated proto-onc\\ngenes from cancers are not sufficient for carcinogenesis. There\\nfore, it has been proposed that mutated proto-one genes depend\\non other proto-one genes for carcinogenesis. Since the oncogene\\nof the avian leukemia virus E26 includes coding regions derived\\nfrom two cellular proto-one genes, proto-myb and proto-eds,\\nthis hybrid gene has been proposed to be a model for two-\\ngeac-carcinogenesis. Here we set out to test this proposal. For\\nthis purpose myb and els deletion mutants of cloned E26\\nprovirus were prepared, and the corresponding viruses, pro-\\nduced by transfected primary chicken embryo cells, were tested\\nfor leukemogenicity in newborn chickens. It was found that an\\nes deletion mutant was just as leukemogenic as the wild-type\\nvirus and that a myb deletion mutant lacked leukemogenicity\\ncompletely. To eliminate the possibility that our £26 myb\\ndeletion mutant failed to be leukemogenic because it failed to\\nreplicate, the virus was titered by a quantitative polymerase\\nchain reaction (PCR) method. By this method, E26 from the\\nplasma of infected chickens was first allowed to reverse-\\ntranscribe viral RNA to cDNA in vitro, and then the cDNA\\nconcentration was determined from the lowest dilution that\\ngave a positive signal after amplification of E26 cDNA by the\\nPCR method. Virus titers of about 10 per ml were found for\\n'wild type and for myè and ets deletion mutants of E26. It is\\nconcluded that the ets regioo not essential for carcinogen-\\nesis, and E26 derives transforming function from overexpres-\\nsion of its proto-myb coding region via the retroviral pro-\\nmoter. Thus, E26 is a single-hit carcinogen and, like all other\\noncogenic retroviruses, is not a andel for two-gene-\\ncarcinogenesis. Viral els probably reflects a genetic accident\\nthat transduced sequences of proto-ets together with proto-\\nmyb in generating E26.\\nOncogenic retroviruses derive transforming function from\\nnonessential viral genes, termed one genes. Retroviral one\\ngenes are genetic hybrids made up from a retroviral promoter\\nlinked to a coding region that has been transduced from one of\\na specific group of cellular genes, termed proto-one genes (1).\\nBecause retroviral one genes and cellular proto-one genes\\nhave coding regions in common, it has been postulated, about\\n12 years ago, that spontaneous mutation may \"activate\"\\ncellular proto-one genes to celiular cancer genes (2-5, 45).\\nAccording to this hypothesis, termed \"oncogene hypothesis.\"\\ncellular cancer genes are mutated proto-one genes (6, 45).\\nBut despite exhaustive efforts, this hypothesis stands\\nunproved. This is because transfection of cloned mutated\\nproto-one genes that have been isolated from cancer cells has\\nconsistently failed to transform any diploid cells (1, 7).

Of\\nmajor soncem is the potential for development of\\nrifampin resistance among areningococci.

Because many foods\\ncontain cadmium, the diet has been considered the\\nmajor source for man. Cigarette tobacco contains\\nappreciable amounts of cadmium, which on burning.\\npasses into the smoke. Analysis of necropsy matenal\\nhas shown that non-smokers accumulate smaller\\namounts of cadmium in their organs then smokers. In\\naddition, the accumulation in smokers is related to\\nthe number of pack-years smoked. It is concluded that\\ntobacco constitutes a major source for cadmium\\naccumulation in mans and in heavy smokers, inhalation.\\nof the cadmium contained in tobacco smoke may make\\na greater contribution to the total body burden than\\nthe amount derived by dietary intake.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nMUCH concern has been expressed in the past few\\nyears regarding the inadvertent exposure of the general\\npopulation to toxic trace metals.

Kiefer\\nResearch Laboratories, Tennessee Eastman Company, Deition of Eastman Kodak Company.\\nKingsport, Tennessee, LISA\\n'\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIt has been shown that, during smoking, compounds\\nwith bolling points as high as 317\" C are not held\\nIrreversibly by the cigarette bite. Previous work in\\nour laboratory indicated that phenol, nicotine, isobutyric\\nacid, 3-pentanone, ethanol, dodecane, tridecane, tetra-\\ndecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and octadecane added\\nto cellulose acetate filter vaporized from the fibers\\nduring smoking of the cigarette. These compounds\\nescaped from the filter by entrapment in nonfiltered\\naerosol particles (a). The method used to investigate\\nthis phenomenon was to add a C-labeled compound.\\nto Elter, smoke the cigarettes, and measure the\\namount of C-labeled compounds that escaped from:\\ntlue filter (3). This method does not accurately simulate\\nfiltration conditions since the Clabeled compounds\\nwere not altered from cigarette smoke but were added.\\nto the filter before the cigarette was smoked The\\npurposes of this work were to develop a technique\\nthat cere closely simulates conditions that occur during\\nfiltration of cigarette smoke than the previous procedure\\ndid (3) and to utilize this new technique to measure:\\n1. the amounts of nicotine and total particulate matter\\n(TPM) that are captured by a filter for at least the\\nducation of a puff, 2. the amounts of captured nicotine\\nand TPM that are eluted from a filter by subsequent\\npufs of smoke, and 3. the amounts of nicotine and\\nTTM that are trapped on the tobacco behind the\\nburning zone. The technique developed in this work\\nutilized filter cigarettes constructed from tobacco\\ntreated with C-labeled nicotine or C randomly\\nlabeled tobacco. The smoking of these cigarettes in\\ntroduced a small amount of the labeled nicotine\\nor C-labeled TPM into the saoke stream immediately\\nbahind the burning zone; subsequently, some of the\\nlabeled components in the smoke were filtered by the\\nsellulose acetate filter. A second Elter cigarette was\\nconstructed from this filter (containing the C-labeled\\nTTM or recotine) and a regular tobacco column. This\\nfilter cigarette was smoked and the quantity of\\nAcceived for publication: ib 7% 1922.\\npreviously fitered labeled nicotine or C-labeled\\nTFM which escaped from the füter was measured.\\nThe escape of filtered \"semi-volatile\" (SV) compounds\\nfrom a cigarette filter is not simple vaporization\\nphenomenon (4). When cigarette smoke passes through\\na filter, the escape of previously trapped SV compounds\\nfrom the filter is appreciable. When sir is passed\\nthrough a filter containing SV compoundķ, there is\\nonly a slight loss of SV compounds from the filter.\\nThus, the passage of smoke zecosol particle through\\na filter is necessary before an appreciable amount of\\nAltered SV smoke compounds can escape from a filter.\\nSome of the processes which probably occur within\\na filter as sigarette smoke passes through it are pre-\\n(not drawn to sale).\\nsented schematically in Fig.\\nAn SV compound which has been filtered can vaporize\\nto some extent from the £ber (A) or from an aerosol\\nparticle (B) and condense elther on another fiber (C)\\nor or another aerosol particle (D). The SV compound\\nthat condenses on an aerosol particle vaporizes from\\nthe partide (E). is removed by filtration as part of a\\nfiltered particle (5), or escapes filtration as part of a\\nnonfiltered partide (G). These processes may occur a\\nnumber of times before the SV compound escapes\\nfrom the Elter This overall process of a filtered SV\\ncompound escaping from a bez by eatrapment in\\nnonfiltered aerosol particles as they pass through the\\nfilter has been designated \"elution\".\\nFigure 1.\\nSchematic diagram of the auton phenomenon\\nSecvente concone\\nApac\\n2021400054",

Va., U.S.A. 23298-0032\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThere is now an extensive literature on environmental Lobacco smoke (ETS). Several meta-\\nanalyses of this literature have combined risk estimates for lung cancer from different studies\\nweighted by the quality and size of the study. Thus, in their meta-analysis, Letzel er al\\n(1988) give various scenarios which use different figures from Hirayama's study, depending\\non whether the husband's or wife's age was used to adjust the wife's cumulative mortality:\\nSince Hirayama's study constitutes about 20% of all lung cancer deaths in the ETS literature,\\nit is important to use the correct relative risk from Hirayama in constructing global esti-\\nmates. Here, it is shown that a proper analysis of Hirayama's study leads to a non-significant\\nassociation between ETS and the risk of death from lung cancer in non-smoking wives.\\nHirayama (1981) reports an age standardised risk ratio of 1.90 for lung cancer anmug\\nnon-smoking women married to heavy smokers and finds a highly significant trend (P <\\n0.001) between the amount smoked by husbands and the lung cancer mortality of their non-\\nsmoking wives. He also interprets this association as arising from a causal relationship between\\nhusband's sinoking and wife's lung cancer:\\nThese results indicate the possible importance of passive or indirect smoking as\\none of the causal factors of lung cancer.\\n{Hirayama, 1981)\\nTRE STUDY\\nDr. Hirayama's study links deaths from all causes occurring in the period 1986 1981 16\\nAtnitest all\\na questionnaire given in late 1965 to approximately 250.000 Japanese adults.\\nthose over age 40 in 24 Health Center Districts in 6 Japanese prefectures who were generally\\nhealthy (Hirayama, 1978) were interviewed. At that time, each respondent was asked for is\\nor her current smoking states. Although not originally designed as a study of the association\\nbetween passive sinking and health, Dr. Hirayama subsequently linked the mortality of wives.\\nwho were classified as non-smokers with their husband's smoking status and, if he was a\\nsmoker, with the amount smoked.\\ntlirayama's smoking classification is based on only one question at the time of the survey\\nas to whether the respondent smoked, and, if so, smoked daily. The respondent was also asked\\nwhether he/she smoked occasionally, was an exsinoker, a non-smoker or an ‘obscure' smoker.\\nThe age at which smoking started was recorded where appropriate. Husband's smoking status.\\nin 1955 was treated as an index of wife's ETS exposure. No direct measure of ETS exposur\\nwas made. In the following.

First, each datum is given equal weight, regard-\\nless of either the size of the country from which it was\\nderived or the quality of the database. Second, nutri-\\ntional factors are highly correlated with one another and\\nwith other nonnutritional factors, many of which may\\naffect disease status.

Ellis\\nEncronmental Health Perspectives\\nVol 8, pp 27-82, 1996\\nGenetic Modulation of the Cellular\\nAntioxidant Defense Capacity\\nby Paul Amstad* and Peter Cerutti*\\nOxidants are ubiquitous in our erobic environment. While they are always toxic, they can also exert\\npathophysiological effects at low concentrations and play an ellological role in human disease. For ex-\\nample, oxidants can stimulate cell growth and act as tumor promoters. The cellular antioxidant defense\\nsystem attenuates the effect of oxidants and consists of low melecular weight components and several\\nenzymes. Most Important are catalase (CATI. superoxide dismutases (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase.\\nWe are tempting to elucidate the role of CAT and CuZnSOD in oxidant tumor promotion of mouse\\nepidermal cells 185. We have found that the promotable clong 41 possesses 2- to 3-fold higher levels of\\nattivity, protein, and stationary mRNA of CAT and Cu Zn-SOD than does the nonpromotable clone 30\\nWe propose that the growth stimulatory effect of oxidants is more pronounced in promotable clone 21\\nbecause it is better protected from oxidant toxicity. In order to corroborate this model, we have constructed\\nJB cells with higher levels of Cu, ZnSOD and CAP by transfection with expression vectors containing\\nDNA for these genes. On the other hand, cell, with decreased amounts of Cu, Zn-SOD have been obtained\\nby their stable transfection with a vector containing SOD-cDNA in the antisense orientation. These cell\\nclones with modified antioxidant enzyme complements are being characterized. In particular, their peo\\nmotability by oxidants and their sensitivity to killing and oxidative macromolecular damage are being\\nmeasured. Certain tumor promoters that lack oxidizing properties may generate cellular procxidant\\nlute by a variety of mechanisms. For example, it had been reported that the phorbol ester TPA decreases\\nthe activities of CAT and SOD in mouse skin. We found for JB6 cells that this loss of enzyme activity was\\ndue to decrease in the steady-state concentrations of CAF and SOD-mRNA. The observed decreases in\\nCAT and SOD can be considered as part of the complex reprogramming of gene expression that is set an\\nmotion by TPA.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nOxidents are toxic to most cells. They inflict damage.\\non several targets, most importantly to lipids, proteins,\\nand DNA. Cells are protected by multiple levels of an-\\ntioxidant defenses. The notion that a gradual decrease\\nin these defenses might play a role in the aging process\\nhas been considered for many years but remains con-\\ntroversial. Comparative studies of the antioxidant ca-\\npacity of tissues of different animal species have sug\\ngested a positive correlation with the maximal lifespan.\\npotential (I). Interestingly, the increase in lifespan of\\nrats by dietary restriction was accompanied by an in-\\ncrease in the activities, mRNA contents, and rates of\\ntranscription of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (UAT)\\nand Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) (A. Richard-\\nson, personal communication). Besides playing a role in\\naging, oxidants possess carcinogenic potential.

The following\\nprincipal alternatives can be distinguished for the action\\nof oxidant promoters. Oxidants and cellular prooxidant\\nstates represent signals for the selective induction of\\ndifferentiation or growth in a particular subpopulation\\nof epidermal cells. Indeed, a burst of extracellular active\\noxygen (AO) induced the competence-related protoon.\\ncogenes cfos and c-myc in mouse epidermal cells JES\\n(5,6). Specific subpopulations may differ in their sus\\nceptibilities to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of\\noxidants (7,5).

In this paper, we present an exploration of the rela-\\ntionship between the amount of nicotine in cigarettes smoked per day, serum\\ncotinine levels, and difficulty in modifying the smoking babit.\\nCotinine is the major nicotine metabolite. In contrast to the short haif-life of\\nnicotine itself, the half-life of cotinine in blood is far longer (30 hr versus 30 min,\\nrespectively). Furthermore, cotinine is usually found in the blood at levels greater\\nthan that of nicotine, and cotinine levels remain fairly constant in individuals\\nwho smoke according to a consistent patters. 247 On this basis, we felt that serum!\\nlevels of cotinine would be a better index of the degree of chronic nicotinism than\\nmeasures of the parent alkaloid. Cotinine is approximately 50 times less toxic than\\nnicotine in rats. 9-10\\nIn this study, participants in a smoking cessation program were asked to rate\\nthemselves in terms of the difficulty they experienced in giving up smoking They\\nalso provided information on the number and type of cigarettes they had been\\nsmoking.

    "text": "The Association between Cigarette Smoking and Age at Cancer\\nDiagnosis\\nBY ARTHUR M. MICHALEX AND K MICHAEL CUMMINGS\\nAbstract The relationship between oigarette smoking and age at concer\\ndiagnosis was examined separately for a vanery of cancer sites in two popular\\ntions of cancer pauent representing two different as spanning a 25 year\\npenod. One study population consisted of 5608 cancer patienas seen at\\nRoswell Park Memonai Enstitute between 1957 and 1965. The second study\\npopulation included over 17000 cancer patients diagnosed n the Werem\\nNew York area between 1979 and 1982. The relationship between cigarette\\nuse and age se diagnosis was found to be consistent for cancer sites examined\\nin both popularions. Cunene awokens were found to be on average, for all\\nsites combined, six years younger at diagnosis than never smokers. These\\nfindings may reflect the immunosuppressive properties of sigarette smoke\\nresulting in eariter age at cancer diagnosis.\\nNumerous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking in-\\ncreases a person's risk of developing cancer (US Public Health 1982; Coll and\\nPeto 1981). However, the effect of cigarette smoking may not just simply lead to\\nan overall increased risk of developing cancer. Cigarette smoking may also\\ncontribute to the occurrence of cancer at an earlier age due to its promotional\\nproperties. Michalek et al. (1985) observed that among patience with bladder\\ncancer, current smokers were on average nine years younger at diagnosis chan\\npersons who had never smoked, and hve years younger than former smokers.\\nThe authors speculated char cigarette smoking may decrease the body's re-\\nsistance to rumor challenge thereby accelerating tumor growth and fessening\\ncime to diagnosis. Experimental studies with animals have shown that chron.c\\nexposure to sigarette smoke results in impaired immune responsiveness (Esber\\nall 1973: Thomas er ai. 1973, 1974, 1974b: Rostam et al. 197): Jacob er all\\n19801. There is also evidence that the immune response may be depressed in\\nkuman-cigarette smokers (Finklea et al. 1971h\\nHowever, the association between age, cigarette smoking, andiuccurrence\\nof cancer is complex and difficult to dissacangie.

Of the 50 compounds tested in all, 23 were found to induce SCE. and these\\ninclude all benzaldehydes but one and the majority of the compounds having a conjugated carbon-carbon\\ndouble bond as well as several of the guaiacols. These groups of active compounds comprise important\\nBavourants such as vanillin. ethylvanillin, isoeugenol and guaiacol. The structure-activity relationships\\nencountered here may be useful in predicting the SCE-inducing activity of related compounds.\\nCigarette smoke condensate is known to exhibit\\nvanous genotoxic effects (DeMarini, 1983; Obe et\\nal., 1984) including induction of sister-chromatid\\nexchange (SCE) in vitro (de Raal, 1979, Hopkin\\nand Evans, 1979). In a previous study, covering\\nthe volatile part of the particulate phase of\\ncigarette smoke, the semi-volatile fraction and its\\n3 subfractions, acids, weak acids and neutrals.\\nwere shown to be poteal inducers of SCE (Curvall\\net al., 1984), while bases were found to be inactive.\\nCorrespondence: Dr. T. Jansson, Genotox Co.. Maria Bangara\\n4. S16 52 Stockholm (Sweden).\\nA number of the constituents of the weakly acidic.\\nsemi-volatile fraction have been identified and\\ntested individually for induction of SCE (Jansson\\net al., 1986). Some of the compounds that were\\nfound to be active are important flavourants often\\nencountered in food, beverages and cosmetics, i.e.,\\nvanillin, cyclotene, guaiacol and isoeugenel. The\\nintegral value of the SCE-inducing activity of the\\nindividual compounds tested could not account\\nfor the total effect of the weakly acidic semi-vola-\\ntile fraction. This fact and the need for a deeper\\nunderstanding of the structure-activity relation-\\nships called for further studies of the SCE-induc\\ning activity of a series of selected compounds.\\n0166-1218/88/500.00 © 1958 Elener Science Publisher: BV (Biomedical Division)\\n\"\\n..\\n2029019292",

The same approach has been used to detect AFB, and AFB, W-Gun as markers of ex\\nposure to aflatoxin B of methy indenine produced as a result of exposure to methylating agents; and thy\\nmine glycol as an Indicator of exposure to agents causing oxidative drange to DNA. Detection of adducts\\nformed between genotoxic agents and hemoglobin has been reported in studies of populations occupation\\nally exposed to ethylene oxide, in which 3-hydroxyhistidine and 3-hydroxyvoline have been measured, and\\nin smokers, whose hemoglobin has been found to contain levels of amicabiphenyl and 2-hydroxyvaline that\\nmoking\\nwere correlated with the frequency of cigarette\\nDetection of DNA adducts of genotoxic agents in the cells and tissues of exposed individuals has also been\\naccomplished through the use of several types of analytical methods.

The nature,\\nscope, and direction of virtually every major component\\nof current environmental health science research have\\nbeen influenced directly or indirectly by Dr. Nelson's se-\\ntivities.

This is a very riately and important area of research\\nendeavor, inasmuch as the process of risk assessment is\\nfinding increasing application by regulatory decision-\\nmaking bodies in the process of formulating policies in-\\ntended to minimize health risks resulting from exposure\\nto hazardous substances. The process of risk assessment\\nrequires the use of factual data to define the health effects\\nof exposure of individuals or of populations to such sub-\\nstances. By current definition, the process of risk assess-\\nment includes three elementa: hazard identification, dose-\\nresponse assessment, and risk characterization. Ex-\\nposure assessment and epidemiology data are key com-\\nportents of the dose-response assessment, the objective\\nof which is to define dose-incidence relationships for ast-\\nverse health effects (such as cancer) in buran popuks\\ntions.

The average weekly concentration of environmental tobacco\\nsmoke was measured with passive monitors that sample nicotine.

These data were in-\\nterpreted with three approaches: companng measured concentrations with a oub-\\nlished risk assessment: comparing occupational exposures with horne exposures:\\nand evaluating the \"cigarette equivalents\" to which workers were exposed.\\nResults. Worksite smoking policy had a major effect on the nicotine concen-\\ntrations, which feil from a median of 8.6 g/m² in the open offices at worksites that\\nallowed smoking to 1.3 µg/m³ in sites that restricted smoking, and to 0.3 µg/m³ in\\nworksites that banned smoking.

Relying on weak and inconclusive\\nepidemiological data, the supposed similarity between ETS and MS, the presence of \"known or\\nsuspected carcinogens\" in MS and by extrapolation in ETS, and the \"biological plausibilny\" of\\nan adverse relationship between ETS and health, the EPA recommended that ETS be classified\\nas a \"Group A (known human) carcinogen.\" Fundamental physical and quantnative chenucal\\ndifferences among ETS, MS. and SS and human exposure to each smoke were disregarded. The\\nthree are not equivalent nor is ETS exposure a quantitative variant of cigarette smoking. A sub-\\nstantial difference in retention percentage overlays the nuge dosimetric difference between exposures.\\nAs a result, the \"dosage\" of ETS retained is miniscute relative to MS. Also, conclusions reached\\nby the EPA and the use of tenuous relationships as bases for Group A classification are unwarranted\\nbecause of failure to consider the data upon which the \"tumorigenicity\" of the ETS components\\nwas based, questions on the presence and/or levels of these components in MS, and data indicating\\nthat a 25- to 30-fold decrease of a high-level dose of MS or MS condensate diminished the effects\\nobserved in bioassays from pronounced to zero. i.c.. a threshold was demonstrated.

Da-\\nspite the bigh rate of heart disease death among never-\\nsmokers, most of those studies have included rola-\\nilvely few cases; only three studies (Hirayama, 1984;\\nHelsing et al, 1984; Dobson et al, 1991) included sub-\\nstantially more than 100 cases. Although some review\\npanela concluded that there was insufficient avidence\\nto infer that ETS exposure increases the risk of heart\\ndisease (National Research Council. 1988; U.S.\\nSurgeon General, 1986), other reviewers have drawn\\nThis work ward in part by the Cantor for Indoor Air Ra.\\nsearch.

Some une late: people\\nrealised that the epidemic had in fact never reached the\\ncountry and that the rise in influenza death rates was\\nmatched by a deficit in deaths ascribed to pneumonia.\\nThis tale, popular among teachers of epidemiology, is\\ndifficult to venfy, and may well have been ambellished\\nin the tradition of story telling. However, occasionally\\nstories come true.\\nA provincial cancer registry issued a warning that\\ncancer rates were increased in an area that had been\\nunder environmental suspicion for some years.' The\\npopular press responded with dramatic headlines.\\nReal estate (property) prices fell the inhabitants.\\nreported health problems among friends and\\nneighbours and contemplated moving, even though\\nindividual respondents showed more resilience in\\ntheir health beliefs. On review, it was found that a\\nwrong denominator had been used, a mistake that\\ncould easily happen because the reporting of\\npopulation figures did\\nfollow the\\nnot\\nadministrative boundanes as the cancer registry. In\\nretrospect, the episode can ever be turned to our\\nadvantage, because it provides an opportunity to learn\\nabout the \"placebo\" part of a commuury's response to\\na perceived cancer risk.\\nsame\\nEven in the absence of panic about industrial waste,\\nepidemics may become partly self-fulfilling. in all\\nprobability, physicians started to designate an ever-\\nincreasing proportion of unexplained sudden deaths\\nin elderly persons as \"coronaries\" when awareness of\\nthe \"epidemics of affluence\" grew. After all, one\\ndiagnoses what one believes is common.\\nElementary mistakes do occur. Thus, another\\npublicity disaster was narrowly avened when a\\nneighbourhood said to have very high cancer rates--\\nagain in relation to toxic waste-was found to contain\\nmostly elderly inhabitants. Simple age standardisation\\ndispelled the wormes. To confound matters further.\\nthe public's reaction is unpredictable. In the\\nNetherlands, the well-meaning advice of health\\nauthenues to remove the upper layers of cadmium-\\ncontaminated garden soil (a legacy of the industrial\\nrevolution of bygone times in an area in the south of\\nthe country) met with stiff popular resistance. An\\naction committee was formed to dispute the\\nepidemiological findings. As the inhabitants pointed\\nout, their fathers had already lived from the fruits of\\nthese gardens, so why should the gardens be destroyed\\nin this way? The arguments of the action committee\\ndid not prevail, however, and finally almost everyone\\ncomplied.\\n:\\nOne difficulty with epidemiology is its popularity\\nwith editors, both medical and in the tabloid press.\\nEpidemiological data make such easy headlines, which\\neveryone can understand and is entitled to have an\\nopinion about \"coffee causes cancer\"; \"breast\\ncancer on the rise\" and so on. The reaction of the\\nprofessionals is often one of annoyance-why don't all\\nthese people see that mere commonsense is no:\\nenough?

At least five interrelated processes are likely\\nto contribute to the clinical manifestations of myocardial infarction:\\natherosclerosis, thrombosis, coronary artery spasm, cardiac arzythmia,\\nand reduced capacity of the blood to deliver oxygen.\\nThe effects of smoking on coronary heart disease are probably\\nmediated by multiple mechanisms, several of which are well established.\\nWhere some of these effects of smoking appear to be reversible within\\ndays or weeks, others may be irreversible or only slowly reversible, such\\nas the development of atherosclerosis due to smooth muscle proliferation\\nand lipid deposition in the arterial intima. However, the relative\\ncontribution of these mechanisms to the increase in incidence of\\ncardiovascular disease caused by smoking is unknown.\\nAfter an exhaustive review of the data, the 1983 Report of the\\nSurgeon General, which was devoted to cardiovascular disease, concluded\\nthat \"cigarette smoking is a major cause of coronary heart disease in the\\nUnited States for both men and women\" and that cigarette smoking should\\nbe considered the most important of the known modifiable risk factors for\\nCHD (2).

But those physicians\\ndo not think of themselves as primary care doctors, so they\\ndo not recommend or ask if the woman has had a mammogram\\nthis year.\" However, the article cited by Breen and Kessler\\nprovides no supporting data for this view.\\nOne of us (S.S.S.) is a thyroidologist who had not previously\\nscreened patients with mammography. In an initial study, we\\ncompared the mammogram results obtained during a 6-month\\nperiod of 75 patients with thyroid disease from the subspe-\\ncialist's thyroid practice with those of 57 controls without\\nthyroid disease from a general internist's practice. The mean\\n(SD) age of the patients with thyroid disease was 53.16 (12.9)\\nyears as opposed to 64.36 (13.7) years for the control group.\\n(P<.001). We were concerned when three new breast cancers\\nwere discovered among the patients with thyroid disease.\\n(subspecialist practice), whereas no new breast cancers were\\nfound in the patients from the general internal medicine\\npractice population. In retrospect, we feel that this was be-\\ncause of a selection bias. Only 18% of the patients in the\\ngeneral internist population had not had previous mammo-\\ngrams, whereas 64% of the patients in the subspecialist popu\\nFation had no previous mammography.\\nIn a subsequent retrospective study, 1000 consecutive pa-\\ntients with thyroid disease in the subspecialist practice were\\nfound to have 38 breast cancers (8.2%). In 223 control patients\\nwithout thyroid disease obtained from general internal medi-\\ndine practices, there were 12 breast cancers (5.4%) (P<.005).\\nThe mean (SD) age of the patients with thyroid disease was\\n47.8 (15.3) years, whereas the mean age of the control group\\nwas 60.7 (17.6) years (P<.001). The average age of breast\\ncancer onset in the thyroid group was 56.5 (12.1) years as\\nopposed to 57.1 (13.9) years in the control group (P>.55). Of\\nthe 88 breast cancer patients in the thyroid population, 11\\n(38%) were not taking levothyroxine at the onset of breast\\ncancer. Their mean (SD) age was 58.5 (1.7) years (P.25)\\nwhen compared with controls). The average age of breasT\\ncancer onset of the remaining 22 patients (67%) receiving\\nlevothyroxine was 58.0 (12.3) years (P5 when compared\\nwith controls). There were 189 patients with a history of\\ntherapy with radioactive iodine (180 for hyperthyroidism and\\nnine for thyroid cancer treatment). Only four of these had\\nbreast cancer (2.19).\\nWe concluded that neither thyroid disease nor thyroid\\nsupplementation increased the risk of breast cancer in the\\ngroup studied.

Measuring exposure to ETS is a complicated task, made difficult by\\nthe complex nature of ETS itself. As the previous panel has discussed. ETS is\\nnot a single substance. Rather, it is a diverse and dynamic mixture consisting\\nof several thousand constituents. Some of these constituents may serve as\\nsurrogates for the ETS mixture as a whole or for potentially significant por-\\ntions of the mixture. However, accurate detection of even these surrogates t\\noften difficult because many are present in extremely low concentrations in\\nair. Further, many substances found in BTS also emanate from other indoor\\nsources, such as building materials and furnishings, cooking and hearing\\nfucks, aerosol propellants and cleaning compounds. Thus, there are subscan-\\ntial problems in attempting to trace the existence of these substances back to\\nETS. Finally the physical and chemical complexity of ETS is increased by its\\npropensity to change over very brief periods of time. Such change can occur\\nas a result of reactions among constituents or between these constituents and\\nother surfaces or chemical sources. This dynamic quality further compheates\\nthe measurement of ETS.\\nGiven these difficulties, it is not surprising that there is no universally\\naccepted and standardized method to quantify the exposure of an individual\\nto ETS. A large number of studies have based estimates of exposure on ref-\\ncospective data obtained from questionnaires. But problems of recall and bias\\nassociated with these subjective responses have led investigators to search for\\na mere objective method for measuring exposure.\\nInvestigators have utilized we such methesis.

Sarrif*\\n1,3-Butadiene and two major genotoxle metabolites 3,4-epoxybutene (EB) and 1,2:34-diepoxybutane\\n(DEB) were used as model compounds to determine if genetic toxicity findings in animal and human cells\\ncan aid in extrapolating animal toxicity data to man. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleas\\ninduction results indicated butadiene was genotoxic in the bone marrow of the mouse but not the rat.\\nThis paralleled the chronic bioassays which showed mice to be more susceptible than rats to 1,3-butadiene\\ncarcinogenicity. However, 1,3-butadiene did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in the rat or\\nmouse hepatocytes following in vice exposure. Likewise, UBS in eat and mouse hepatocytes in vitro was not\\ninduced by LB or DEB. Salmonella typhimurium gene mutation ( (Amet) tests of 1,3-butadiene using strains\\nTA1535, TA97, TA98, and TA100 and employing rat, mouse, and human liver 59 metabolic systems were\\nbarely 3-fold above background only in strain TA1533 at 30% 1.3-butadiene in air with induced and upinduced\\nrat S9 and mouse 89 (uninduced). 1,3-Butadiene was negative in in vitro SCE studles in human whole blood\\nlymphocytes cultures treated in the presence of rat, initse, or human liver 89 metabolic activation.

These differences in carcinogenic potency have\\nraised the question as to which of the two species, if\\neither, is the better indicator of the human response.\\nStudies evaluating the mutagenic response to 1,8-bu\\ntadiene in vivo and in vitro in rodents and humans should\\npermit a more quantitative catimation of toxicological\\ndifferences between man and rodents. We examined the\\npossibility that the genotoxicity of 1,3-butadiene or\\ngenotoxic metabolites is a major contributing factor to\\nits carcinogenic activity in rodents.\\nTwo known genotoxic metabolites, 3,4-epoxybutene\\n(EB) and 1,28,4-epoxybutane (DEB) are formed in vio\\n(4) and in vitro (5,6) and both bind covalently to DNA\\n(7-9). 3,4-Epoxybutene was reported to be genotoxic in\\nKlebsiella and Salmonella (10) and induce sister chro-\\nmatid exchange and chromosome aberrations in mice.\\n(11.12).

The most extensively studied\\nare polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH*) (2). The PAH\\nthat have been classified as animal and potential human\\ncarcinogens (2) are present in the air predominantly in partic-\\nulate form, in a respirable panicles fraction of <25 µm (3).\\nThe main sources of PAH are power plants, industrial and\\nresidential heating, motor vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoking\\nand other processes of incomplete combustion and pyrolysis of\\norganic material (4). These compounds are primarily activated\\nthrough, zn oxidative metabolic pathway to electrophilic inter-\\nmediates capable of covalent binding to cellular DNA to form\\nDNA adducts. These adducts, if they are not repaired or are\\nmisrepaired, may initiate gene mutations and lead to adverse\\nhealth effects in humans (5.6). Therefore, measurement of\\nDNA adducts may be useful for evaluation of the biologically\\neffective dose as a more relevant parameter for assessing risk\\nfrom exposure to PAH (7-9). Detection of DNA adducts\\nprovides not only direct evidence that humans have been\\nexposed to specific chemicals, but also that potentially pre-\\ncarcinogenic lesions have been formed. The individuals with\\nmeasurable DNA adduct levels can reasonably be considered\\nto be at potentially higher risk of cancer as a result of that\\nexposure (10).\\nAssays for detection of aromatic DNA adducts have been\\ndeveloped during the last decade, such as P-postlabeling\\n(11-14) and immunoassays (15,16). The most sensitive assay\\nfor monitoring of human DNA that requires only small amounts\\nof DNA (1-10 µg/assey) is the 12P-postlabeling method. This\\nmethod i capable of detecting DNA adducts present at levels\\nas adduct/10°-101 nucleotides (14,17). Using this\\nmethod an environmentally exposed population from a highly\\npolluted area in Silesia (Poland) was shown to have 2-3 times\\nhigher adduct levels in their white blood cells (WBC) as\\ncompared with a population from a rural area (18-20). In both\\nof these population groups seasonal variations in WBC DNA\\nadduct levels were observed (21). Analyzing DNA adduct\\nlevels separately in DNA isolated from lymphocytes and\\ngranulocytes, seasonal variations in the environmentally\\nexposed population were even higher and were found only in\\nthe lymphocytes (22).

Such\\ndiscoveries place researchers in the early but hopeful stages of translating fundamental\\nfindings into new treatments that address the neurobiologic basis of drug craving—even\\nfor cocaine, against which there are currently no pharmacologic interventions.\\nDrug addiction is fundamentally a brain disease.\\nThis seemingly straightforward observation is ac-\\ntually the outcome of dramatic changes in our un-\\nderstanding of substance abuse. Betore the ad-\\nvances, addiction was typically seen as a purely be\\nhavioral disorder, characterized internally by drug\\ncraving and externally by compulsive (and harm-\\nful) drug-seeking behavior. Its chief pathophysio-\\nlogic manifestation was the withdrawal syndrome\\nresulting from abstinence. Neurobiologically, how-\\never. It is now known that the drug addicted brain\\nis qualitatively different from the nonaddicted\\nbrain, as manifested. for example, by global de-\\nelines in glucose metabolism and intraneuronal\\nchanges in gene expression. In effect, a \"switch\" has\\nbeen thrown. Although the precise molecular na-\\nture of the switch remains unknown. current\\nknowledge implicates activation of the brain's\\nmesolimbic dopamine system as a common de-\\nnominator in at least the acute effects of all abuseri\\ndrugs.\\nBehavioral science advances have been equally\\nsignificant. They show that the addicted bram is\\nabnormally conditioned. so that environmental\\ncues surrounding drug use have become part of the\\naddiction. Suspicion of the importance of such\\ncucs dates at least to the era of the Vietnam War.\\nfrom which roughly 100.000 Americans returned\\naddicted to heroin.

Meanwhile, the behavioral-science\\nadvances emphasize that drug addiction is a brain\\ndisease embedded in a social context.

For example, opiates bind to the brain's\\nopioid receptors. whereas cocaine binds to the\\npump molecule responsible for uptake of the neu\\nrotransmitter dopamine into presynaptic axon ter-\\nninals.

Box,\\nCH-4002 Basel, Switzerland\\nReceived September 23, 1996\\nThe rumor suppressor gene p53 is the most frequently mutated\\ngeue found in conjunction with human cancer. 1.2 The p53\\nprotein can also be inactivated by binding to viral or cellular\\nproteins such as the human homologue of the mouse double-\\nminute gene product (MDM2) that upon binding inactivates\\nthe transcription activity of p53. Thus, in certain human cancers\\n(carcinomas, sarcomas, and glioblastomas\"), the overexpres\\nsion of the oncogene MDM2 inhibits p53 tumor suppressor\\nactivity. Chemotherapeutic agents that could prevent the\\nbinding of p53 to MDM2 in such tumors would release p53\\nactive for tumor suppression. We report herein an NMR study\\nby transfer NOE experiments of a p53-derived peptide in\\ncomplex with MDM2. The data reported in this paper may be\\nuseful in the rational drug design of specific highly active\\ninhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction.\\nThe interaction between p53 and MDM2 has been previously\\ncharacterized by mutagenesis. These experiments show that\\nresidues 14, 19, 22, and 23 of p53 (Scheme 1) are crucial for\\nthe interaction. In addition, it was shown that a short synthetic\\npeptide corresponding to amino acids 18-23 of p53 can bind\\nMDM2, revealing that this region of the protein is most\\nimportant for die interaction.\" Finally, the p53 binding domain\\nhas been localized in the N-terminal domain (about 100 amino\\nacids) of MDM2.12-14 This formed the starting point of our\\ninvestigation which led to the presented structural information\\nabout the interaction between the two proteins.\\nThe N-terminal domain of MDM2, residues 1-188, was\\nexpressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-\\nMDM2) in Escherichia coli. To ensure that the MDM2 moiety\\nof the fusion protein is functional, ELISA experiments were\\nperformed. The protein p53 indeed interacts only with the\\nimunobilized GST-MDM2 protein but not with immobilized\\nGST alone (Figure 1A).

Furdieratore, chemical shifts and coupling\\nconstants were found close to random coil values, suggesting\\nthat the peptide lacks a predominant conformation in its\\nunligated state.\\nTransfer NOE experiments were measured on a 10:1\\nmixture of this peptide and GST-MDM2.

An essential part of the spectrum recorded\\nwith a mixing time of 150 ms is presented in Figure 2. No\\ntranster NOEs were detected in control experiments for the\\npeptide and the GST protein alone. Note that various nonse-\\nquential crosspeaks are observed, indicating the presence of\\ndefined structure (e.g., the aromatic proton Hỗ resonance of\\nPhe experiences NOEs with proton resonances of Pro, Asp?',\\nand Leu as indicated in this part of the spectrum).

Wherever cobacco pro-\\ncucks is consumed, they are taxed. Further,\\nwhite taxation policy varies widely from state\\nto state, the taxation of tobacco produce is\\nalmost always an important element of govern-\\nment policy toward tobacco and toward smek-\\ning. Tobacco taxation policy varies over cime\\nas well as cross-sectionally. For example.\\nrecent years have witnessed relatively share\\nincreases in tobacco tax policy in Canada and\\nmujor efort to create harmonisation of elga-\\nrette taxenon policy in the Europea Com-\\nmunity by substandal increases in cox for tow\\nincome tax nations. Since the autumn of\\n1993, a substantial increase in the per package\\ngarete tax has been proposed by the Clinton\\nadministration as a major founding vehicle for\\ncomprehensive health care reform in the\\nUnited States Cigarette x pulicy also serves\\nas a window into social attitudes about smoking\\nbecause cigarecce suxation policies not in-\\nfrequently reflect shifts in views about cigar-\\ncres and smokers.\\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a policy\\ncontext for reviewing what is currently knewn\\nabout the effect of cigarette taxes on smoking;\\nand what needy to be determined to provide on\\nadequate fcrual basis for informed policy In\\nthe first part of the acalpsis are discuss three\\ndifferent purposes of cigarette taxation and the\\nrelationship between each of these and th:\\nlever of taxation that would be regarded as\"\\noptimally appropriate. In this section we also\\nprobe the relationship between vamous pur-\\nposes of axetion and theories of justice.\\nIn the second part of the page; we discuss\\ncurrent knowledge about the behavioural\\neffects of cigarette sacation. In this section we\\nexamine the impact of tax leveis on the\\nprevalence and incidence of smoking, as well as\\nthe impact of taxation and price changes on the\\nbehaviour of particular target groups such as\\nyoung people, low income groups, and (mokers\\nwach some intention of ceasing to smoke. We\\nalso discuss the lateral effects of smoking\\ntaxation on consumer behaviour and family\\nwetare.\\nIn the third section we discuss the be-\\nhavioural processes that result in higher prices\\nIndusing cigarette consumption. We disous-\\nwith four different mechanisms and suggest\\nways to assert the relative impact of each. A\\nconcluding section suramarises the research\\ntasks we recommend to assist in traming\\ncigarete taxation policy.\\nThree objectives of cigarette caxation\\nGovernment tax peitoy toward agrestres can\\nbe intended to serve at least three objectives:\\nrevenue: efhmency, and deterrence The\\ngeneration of government reteaue is the first\\npurpose of casabon, both tuntonally and\\nhistorically, in the modem state Tobacco\\ntaxes, far from being an exception to this\\npattem, caditonally were Classified\\n\"luxury\"\\nor \"vice\", a category which is\\nparticularly susceptible to tax rates that are\\nquite high in relation to total consumer cost of\\nthe product.

The use of biomarkers is increasing both in acute and chronic disease epidemiology, but the\\nrationale for their introduction is not always firmly established (eg, when and how their use is scientifically\\njustifiable and cost effective).\\nThe use of biomarkers should be considered within the context of causal models in epidemiology, and of\\nthe intertwining of causation and pathogenesis. Unlike infectious diseases, for cancer and cardiovascular\\ndisease external \"necessary\" causes have not been identified. Thus, the classification of cancer and other\\nchronic diseases cannot be based on unequivocal criteria such as the \"etiologie\" classification of infectious\\ndiseases. As far as morphology is concerned, “neoplasia\" and \"anaplasia\" are attributes of cancer that cannot\\nbe defined in a straightforward way. Tissue pathologies are minimal and difficult to differentiate from normal\\ntissue in soune cancers but are obvious in others. From a mechanistic point of view, unless molecular biology\\ndiscovers specific mechanistic steps in carcinogenesis, which indicate the existence of \"necessary\" events in\\ncarcinogenesis, we canot adopt an unequivocal definition of cancer. The potential contribution of biomarkers\\nto the elucidation of the pathogenetic process should be considered in the light of such uncertainties.\\nThere is a range of indications for biomarkers, from the use of very specific measurements aimed at single\\nmolecules, to ceasurements indicating cumulative exposure to agents with the same mechanism of action.\\nThe potential uses of markers in chronic disease epidemiology include (1) exposure assessment in cases in\\nwhich craditional epidemiologic tools are insufficient (particularly for low doses and tow risks); (2) multiple\\nexposures or mixtures, in which the aim is to disentangle the etiologic role of single agents (3) estimation of\\nthe total burden of exposure to chemicals having the same mechanistic targets (4) investigation of pathogenetic\\nmechanisms, and (5) study of Individual susceptibility (eg., metabolic polymorphism, DNA repair), ) SUN\\nEPIDEMIOL 49:9:951-956, 1996.\\nKEY WORDS.

In the following decades these\\nobservations were not only confirmed by several hundreds of prospective and case-control\\nstudies but the plausibility of this causal association was also supported by isleassays and\\nby the identification of carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

The particularę mniter of\\nthe smoke elicits benign and malignant tumors on the skin of mice and rabbits, sarcoma\\nin the connective tissue of rats, and carcinoma in the lungs of rats upon nitratracheal\\ninsulfation. More than 30 carcinogens have been identified, Including the following classes\\nof compounds: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAN), aromatic amines, and N.\\nnitrosamines Aunong the latter, the tobacco-specific Nuestrosanines (TSNA) have been\\nshown to be of special significance.\\nSince 1950, the makeup of cigarettes and the composition of cigarette smoke have\\ngradually changed to the United States, the sales-weighted average \"rar\" and nicotine\\nyields have declined from a high of 38 mg \"car\" and 2.7 mg nicotine in 1954 to 12 ng\\nand 0.95 mg in 1992, respectively.

The agency's premises were\\nthat the vast majority of tobacco users self-administer\\nthe product for the drug effects of nicotine and to\\nsustain addiction and that cigarette manufacturers\\ncontrol the levels of nicotine in cigarettes to maintain\\nthis addiction. The FDA further raised the possibihey\\nof regulating cigarettes on the basis of their nicotine\\ncontent to prevent addiction.\\nOn February 28, 1904, the ABC news program. Day\\nOne presented evidence that tobacco manufacturers.\\nmanipulate the nicotine content of cigarettes. One\\nway they do this is by removing nicotine from tobacco\\nand then adding it back in controlled amounts, using\\ntobacco extracts containing nicotine. It was suggested\\non the news program that the amount of nicotine in\\ntobacco was controlled to ensure that the level was\\nadequate to maintain nicosine addiction. In support\\nof this idea the program quoted an internal memoran-\\ndum from a Philip Morris Tobacco Company scientist\\nthat land been discovered in recent litigation: \"The\\ncigarette should be conceived not as a product but as a\\nSmoke is be-\\npackage. The product is nicotine.\\nyond question the most optimized vehicle of nicotine\\nand the cigarette the most optimized dispenser of\\nsmoke. That the pharmacologic actions of nicotine\\nare important determinants of why people smoke is\\nsupported by studies conducted by the tobacco indus-\\ntry and by nonindustry researchers\\nThat nicotine addiction sustains tobacco use for\\nmest smokers is well established. Once a person is\\naddicted to nicotine, quitting smoking is difficult, and\\nmore than 90 percent of the smokers who try to quit\\neach year fail. An important, if not the most impor\\ntant, component of a policy to reduce tobacco use in\\nthe population is to prevent the development of nico-\\ndine addiction in young people.\" Young people do not\\nstart to smoke because they are addicted, but rather\\nbecause of psychosocial and environmental influ-\\nences, particularly peer influences, psychological fac-\\ntoes, and advertising. Young people generally under-\\nestimate the addictiveness of nicotine, and most of\\nthem at first intend to smoke only for a few years.\\nHowever, once they begin to smoke, many become\\naddicted to nicotine, and this addiction sustains the\\nself-injurious behavior into adulthood. The result of\\nnicotine addiction is a 40 percent probability of pre-\\nmature death from illness caused by tobacco' It is\\ndifficut to prevent adolescents from experimenting\\nwith cigarettes. However, by regulating the availabil-\\nity of nicotine in tobacco products, it may be possible.\\nto prevent the transition from experimental or occa-\\nsional smoking to addiction. This paper examines the\\nproposition that the level of nicotine likely to produce\\naddiction can be estimated and that mandating a nico-\\ntine content below that level is a feasible approach to\\ntobacco regulation.\\nIS THERE A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF NICOTINE\\nINTAKE ASSOCIATED WITH ADDICTION?\\nWe define addiction according to the Surgeon Gen\\neral's 1988 Report on Nicotine Addiction: it is the\\ncompulsive use of a drug that has psychoactivity and\\nthat may be associated with tolerance and physical\\ndependence (ie., may be associated with withdrawal\\nsymptoms after the cessation of drug use).

The executive order reflected a\\ngrowing emphasis on well-recognized differences in the exposures,\\nmetabolism, and disease responses of infants and children to chemi-\\nal axposures.\\nConcem about the special vulnerability of infants and children\\nto environmental exposures, particularly pesticides, prompted the\\nU.S. Congress in 1956 to request that the National Academy of\\nSciences study this issue. This study resulted in the important 1993\\nreport Pesticides in the Dies of Infants and Children (2). In its\\nNational Agenda to Protect Children from Environmental Health\\nThus, the U.S. Suvironmentd Protection Agency (EPA) com-\\nmited itself to ensuring that all standards it adopts will protect\\nchildren (). In 1997, the EPA solicited comnenes from the public\\non which standards to reevaluate so assess special needs of children.\\nand a national advisory commince identified several ropics-mer-\\ncury emissions, protection from farm chemicals, attarine in food\\nand water, and organophosphate and carbamate petricicles (4).\\nThe foxas on children is teengaging the public health communi-\\nty in the environmental health arena after a period of seeming indif-\\nference. This shift, coupled with a renewed emphasis on the safety of\\nfood and water supplies, represents a renuissance for environmental\\nhealth and an important challenge. The protection of dildren will\\nrequire, among other things, that guidelines for carcinogen risk\\nassessment address children.\\nThese concerns make the proposed revised EPA guidelines for\\ncarcinogen risk assessment of particula interest. It is importani to\\nensure that die guidelines address cancer risks for children and to\\nprotect children and infants. The most recent draft of the guide-\\nfines was issued in 1996 (5). The draft was released hetore adop.\\ntion of the executive order and did not include any direct mention\\nof how to assess the particular needs of children. This draft remains\\nunder review.\\nFederal policy has one example of a stature written with the\\nintent of providing special protections for infants and children. The\\nFood Quality Protection Act (FQPA) ( passed in 1996 by a waan\\nimous vote of the Congress, amended federal laws regarding pod-\\ncides in two ways that were particularly important for children. First.\\ndie stanute requires that when allowable levels of pesticides for foods\\nare ser, special protections be provided for children. The stature ree-\\nognizes that the exposure of children may differ from that of adults.\\nand. in this case, mandates collection of data about food consump\\nbon parent of children (seruon 301). It incorporates scientific prin\\nciples in mandating that all routes of exposure to pesticides be con-\\nsidered in assessung risk tection 405) Second, federal agencies are to\\nconsider whether infans and children may be disproportionately sus\\nceptible to pesucades and to consider the potential for combated\\n1786\\nPatricia A Butler\\nimpacts of chemicals with common\\nmechanisms of action. These are\\nimportant new principles for scien\\nritically grounded policy that will\\nbe protective of children. When\\ndata are not adequate to allow for\\nassessment of differences in expo-\\nsure and musceptibility for children,\\npesticide tolerances are to incorpo-\\nrate an additional safety factor of\\n10. Although the process of implementation of these fundamental\\nnew directions may be difficult and will require adjustment both by\\nregulatory agencies and by pesticide users and producers, these\\nimportant policy goals are worthy of consideration in the context of\\nguidelines for risk assessment for chemical carcinogens.\\nToxic responses in indines and children can diffe markedly from\\nthose seen in adults, both in severity and in the nature of the adverse\\neffect. During the growth and maturation process there is an evolu-\\ntion of membranes, including receptors, in infants and children as\\nthey approach adulthood. These changes represent a potential for\\nvery different environment for chemical and drug interactions with\\nreceptors. Examples of differences in drug-receptor interactions\\nbetween children and adults are provided by the paradoxical respons\\nes to phenobarbital and Kiralin in children versus adults.\\nPhenobarbital, a sedative in adults, produces hyperactivity in chil-\\ndren, whereas Rivalin, which is used as an antihyperactive agent in\\nchildren, produces an opposite effect in adule. The explanation for\\ndhese widely differing responses in children and adults is believed to\\nreride in differences in receptor-drug interactions (7).\\nDifferences in the developing infunt and chill also elfen, absoupe\\ndon, dose, distribution, bioczansformation, sorage, and excretion of\\nchemicals on drugs in the body, and therefore toxicity (2). Of particu-\\nLar interest are the enzymes involved in metabolism of toxic com\\npounds. The enzymes important to both phase i transformation\\nthrough the cytochrome P450 system and phase 2 transformation can\\nvary with age (8). This variability can result in differences in sensitivity\\nto the toxic effects of pharmacologic agents and xenobiotics.\\nMoreover, children may also have less capacity to repair damage.\\nPertops the most distinguishing, characteristic of infine 2nd chi\\nɖrên is that they grow and develop. Different systems and organs\\ndevelop at different rates and at different phases (). Children may\\nbe more vulnerable to chemical exposures that affect growing tissue.\\nA critical period for exposure to radiation in the mammary gland is\\nthe period during adolescence when cells are proliferating.\\nStudies of effects of radiation provide evidence of incased suscep\\nability of those exposed during chukdhood (10), Auming the survivors\\nof radiation from the exploding of the atomic borrb, susceptibility\\nto leukemia was greater for those who were under 20 yeus of age.\\nwhen exposed as compared to chose who were older.

Method: The authors used a 35% CO2\\nand 65% O₂ mixture as a challenge agunt. Filty-one unitsdicated subjects with DSM-IN-\\npanic disorder, who wore divided into respiratory (N=28) and nonrespiratory (N=29) sub-\\ntypes by their sympton profiles, underwent a CO₂ challange proceduro. Patients in uno twe\\ngroups were compared with regard to physiological and psychological measures, pu'mo\\nnary function tests, parle rates, and smoking habits Results: The patients in the respira-\\ntory group were significantly more sensitive to CO₂ than wore the patients in the nonrespi-\\nratory group. The respiratory group also had higher scores on the Panic and Agoraphobia\\nScale and had a longer duration of illness; both of these racters can be indicators of illness\\nseverity. In addition, the respiratory group's higher cigarette consumption (mean-12.45\\npackage-years, SD-2.49) may have been a contributory faclar not only for illness severity\\nbut also for the pathogenesis of panic disorder.

Jasinski\\nThe Johns Hopkins University\\nBaltimore, Maryland, USA\\n203\\nAddiction is a behavior that is defined as including a psychic and clinical reliance on a chemical or\\naubatance (1,3). Addiction behavior is distinct from drug use, misuse or abuse. Addiction implies a\\nloan of control over ingestion in association with harm to the individual or sodaty, Knowledge about\\nclinical manifestations of addiction is gained from treatment situations; from toxic consequences of\\nsubstance abuse; from overdose situations; and, most importantly, from experimental pharmacology\\n_ studies in humans. This presentation will focus primarily on the reaults of experimental\\npharmacology studies in humans that document and elucidate clinical manifestations of addiction.\\nThe initial drug of public health and social concern that led to support for scientific studies was\\nopiates (morphine is the prototype) (3). Knowledge of the important phenomena and of the addictive\\nprocess developed from experimental studies of morphine in addicts. It is important to emphasize\\nthat the addictive procesa involves not only the pharmacologic effects of the drugs but is known to\\ninvolve learning, mechanisms, the environment, and the predisposing biologie states or baits of the\\nsubstance abusera (1, 2). The classic pharmacologic effects involved in the adductive prossa are\\neuphoria, tolerancy and physical dependence. Examples from studies on opiates, stimulants,\\nsedatives, A-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and nicotine will be discussed.\\nStudies of Euphoria\\nWhen given morphine, addicts discrbainate the effect of torphine from placebo and from other\\nclasses of druge (3, 4, 5, 6). There is a constellation of effects that are dose related. One cot of effects\\nfrom morphine in addicts is pleasurable and is liked (3, 4, 5, 6). These subjective changes are\\ndescribed as euphoria and are measured by increases in \"Liking Scale\" and a specific euphoria scale\\n⚫the \"Morphine Bencedrine Group scale (BG). These euphoric effects are accorpanied by come\\ndysphoric effects. This reponse in addicts is contrasted to the effects of morphine in non-addicts where\\n70% dislike the offects and report only dysphona. Other opiates such as codeine, horcin, methadone,\\nand meperidine produce similar effects in addicts (3). They differ predominantly in mg-for-mg potency.\\nThe comparison of potances in addicte and in relief of pathologic pain in non-addicts indicates a\\nsimilarity and a lack of celectivity of analgesic effects (3). It should be noted that the\\nagoniat/antagoniat druga do abow some selectivity separating the analgesic from euphoric offheta (3,\\n7,8,9).\\nIn addiction to opiates, experimental studies show the experienced addlers can discriminate\\namong classes of drugs if given large enough doses (6, 9). Those other cloages of drugs do produca biting\\nand MBG responses. Some effects, however, are specific to the pharmacologic effects of the drugs being\\nPaper presented at the lat Annual Meeting of the Japanese Forum on Nicotine and Drug Dependence.\\nJune 6, 1998 in Tokyo, Japan.\\n2084318581",

Department of Medicine, Dive Julm's Hapkins Hospital,\\nBaltimore, Maryland 27205\\nReceived December 26, 1979, and in revived farm May 1, 1980\\nNitrogen dioxide (NO) is used experimentally to produce a controlled diffuse alveolar\\ninjury in animals. A lination of these studies has been uncertainty over the concentration\\nof gas ultimately reaching the lung. since the upper respiratory trust acts as a scrubbing\\nmeclunina. The upper airway can be bypassed by using a system of unilateral bronchial\\nconnulation originally developed for the study of collateral ventilation. The technique was\\nemployed in five beagle dogs, ventilaung the left long with 37 ppm NO, to air and the right\\nlung with room at under light anesthesia for 4 hr. During the exposure oxygen uptake was\\nmeasured in each tung at half-hour intervals and blood was taken for complete blood count\\nand differential, methemoglobin level, and plasma hemoglobin. After the exposure period\\nthe animals were sacrificed and the lungs were fixed for light microscopy and electron\\nmicroscopy with morphometry. Oxygen uptake dropped abruptly and markedly but revert\\nbly in the NO exposed lung, compatible with induction of a ventilation-perfusion inequal-\\nity. The hematologic measurements did not change significamily over the period of exposure.\\nThe climastructural findings, analyzed by morphometry, suggest acute endothelial injury and\\nearly interstitial edema. These findings can be integrated into an overall selema of NO, toxic\\ninhalation suggested by the recent literature. In this scheme injury to the pulmonary vascular\\nencorum is an early structurat change, accompanied by functional changes resulting from\\nbronchospasm and possible alterations in pertusión, and followed by vascular permeability\\nchanges leading to interstitial edema.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nNitrogen dioxide (NO) produces a diffuse alveolar and terminai bronchiolar\\ninjury when inhaled in sufficient concentration (Guidotti. 1978). Toxic inhadation\\nof NO, is both a practical problem due to occasional accidental occupational\\nexposure and an experimental tool which produces a controlled deep pulmonary\\ninjury useful in the study of reparative mechanisms in the lung. A better under-\\nstanding of the mechanisms and effects of NO, in the lung may contribute both\\npractical and theoretical benefits to inhalation toxicology (Guidotti, 1978, 1979).\\nStudies of NO, and other toxic gases by chamber or mask exposure share a\\ncommon problem of uncertainty regarding the precise concentration delivered to\\nthe lower respiratory tract. The trachea and nasopharynx of lurge animals act as\\nefficient scrubbing mechanisms with mass transfer rates proportional to the transit\\ntime and surface area of the upper airways (Corner al., 1976; Vaughn et al., 1969;\\nDelhamn er at.. 1963).

Ex-\\nercise Physiol. 52(3): 725-733, 1982.-Retrograde catheter and\\nforced random noise techniques were combued to study the\\ndistribution of resistance and compliance in togs following the\\nnhalation of aurosols containing 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml of hista-\\nmune. Mean base-line peripheral resistance was 0.367 cmH 0.\\nJa, agreeing with previous estimates. After correction for the\\nendotracheal tube, the mean central airway resistance was 0.040\\nemH,0-8, considerably lower than previous estimates. This\\ndiscrepancy was attributed to an overcorrection for the endo-\\ntracheal tube resistance. The lower histamine dose caused a\\nsubstantial increase in periphoral resistance, a relatively small\\nincrease in central resistance, and substantial decreases in total\\nand peripheral compliance. After the higher histamine dose,\\nchanges in peripheral resistance and both compliances were\\nsimilar to those obtained with the lower dose; however, the\\nincrease in central resistance was much larger than at the lower\\ndose. The difference between total and peripheral compliance\\nyielded estimates of airway compliance of 0.0006 1/enH.O\\nbefore and 0.00104 1/cmH2O after 2.5 mg/ml of histamine.\\nrespiratory resistance; respiratory compliance; airway compli\\nance; central resistance; peripheral resistance; histamine expo-\\nsure; airway reactivity\\nTHE RETROGRADE CATHETER technique has been used to\\nstudy the distribution of resistance in the lung and the\\neffect of various interventions on this distribution (12, 13,\\n17, 18, 31, 32, 33). In general measurements are made\\nusing single-frequency forced oscillations, and some ques-\\ntions have been raised concerning the reliability of these\\nmeasurements (12). The forced random noise approach\\nfor characterizing impedance may overcome these diffi-\\nculties, because measurements are averaged over several\\nfrequencies and over several time intervals, and because\\nmany of the measurements are away from the resonant\\nfrequency. In addition, the forced random noise tech-\\nnique provides simultaneous estimates of compliance na\\nwell as resistance. We have therefore used random nouse\\nin conjunction with a retrograde catheter technique to\\nstudy the distribution of respiratory resistance and com-\\npliance in dogs and the effect of inhaled histamine on\\nthese parameters.\\nMETHODS\\nmethohexital sodium (3 mg/kg), anesthetized with chlor-\\nalose (80 mg/kg) and urethan (800 mg/kg), intubated\\nwith an 8.5-mm cuffed endotracheal tube (Rusch), and\\nventilated mechanically with a Harvard Apparatus\\nmodel-607 ventilator. Supplementary doses of chloralose\\nand urethan were administered as required to maintain\\nanesthesia. Chloralose and urethan were used as the\\nanesthetic because pentobarbital sodium may inhibit\\nreflex bronchoconstriction in dogs (14). An intravenous\\nsuline drip was administered throughout the experiment,\\nand an arterial fine was placed to monitor blood pressure\\nund to obtain periodic samples of arterial blood for de-\\ntermination of arterial blood gases. A rectal probe (Yel-\\nlow Springs Instrument) was used to monitor body tem\\nperature, and a heating pad was applied to maintain body\\ntemperature.\\nForced random noise measurements of total respire-\\ntory impedance (including the impedance of the endotra-\\ncheal tube) were made using the apparatus shown in Fig.\\n1. A random pressure signal, band limited to approxi-\\nmately 20 Hz, was generated by a special noise generator\\n(8) and used to drive an Acoustic Research AR loud-\\nspeaker. This random pressure fluctuation was coupled\\nto the animal's respiratory system through a screen preu-\\nmotachometer (Hans-Rudolph model 3700) via the en-\\ndotracheal tube. The pressure drop across the pneumo-\\ntachometer screen was measured with a Validyne MP-45\\npressure transducer to detect the induced random flow\\nsignal. The pressure at the entrance to the endotracheal\\ntube was coupled through 15 cm of PE-200 tubing to\\nanother Validyne MP-15 to detect the applied random\\npressure signal.

By utilizing transfection\\nassay, Southern blot analysis, and DNA amplification tech-\\nniques, we have detected an activated Kiras gene in the DNAs\\nof both spontaneously occurring and chemically induced fung\\ntumors of strain A mice. The point mutations in the sponta\\nneous lung tumors were in both codon 12 (60) and codon 61\\n(30%). In contrast, 100% of the mutations in the Kiros gene\\ndetected la methylnitrosourca-induced lung tumors and 93% of\\nthe mutations in the Kiras genes detected in benzo[a]pyrene-\\ninduced lung tumors were in cedon 12, whereas 90% of the\\nmutations in the K-ras genes detected in ethyl carbamate-\\nInduced lung tumors were in codon 61. The selectivity of\\nmutations fu the Khres oncogene observed in chemically\\ninduced tumors, as compared to spontaneous tumors, suggests\\nthat these chemicals directly induce point mutations in the\\nKiras pretooncogene. These data indicate that the strain A\\nmouse lung tumor model is a very sensitive system to detect the\\nability of chemicals to activate the Ki-res proteoncogene in leng\\nissue.\\nThe strain A mouse lung tumor bioassay has been utilized for\\ntesting more than 300 compounds for carcinogenic activity\\n(1-4).

In combina-\\ntion with these potential carcinogens, cigarette smoke contains\\ncompounds which induce a number of cytochrome P450\\nIsozymes, including CYP1A1, 142 and 2E1 (6-8). Inomased\\nexpression of these and other drug metabolizing enzymes may\\ninfluence the carcinogenicity of the mixture, since they can\\nhiorransform cigarette stroke constituents such as benzo[a]pyr-\\n(B[a]P) and 4-(methynitrosamino)-1-(2-pyridyl)-butanone\\nto reactive electrophiles (9-12).\\nIt has been assumed that cigarette moke up-regulates\\nenzyme expression, at least in part, though the zoonotic\\nhydrocarbon receptor (AR). Upon ligand binding, the ARR\\nis uanstecated to the nucleus where it heterodimerizes with\\nthe aromatic hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein\\n(ARNI). The AhR-ARNT complex specifically binds to\\ndioxin responsive elements (DRE) and inutiates gese\\ntion in adjacent genes (13-17). Recently, Gebremicheel et al.\\n(18) directly demonstrated that cigarette smoke contains high\\naffinity AhR ligands which are capable of transforming the\\nreceptor to an active transcription factor. However, the con-\\nsequence of AhR-mediated enzyme induction on the carcinos\\ngenicity of cigarette smoke is not clem. It is possible that\\nconstitutive P450 scovites dictate the genetic toxicky of\\ncigarette smoke or that other biochemical processes (e.g. DNA\\nrepair) obscure any differences resolidog from AhR-meclated\\ngece Canscription. Altimately, AhR-dependent events may\\nsignificandy influence cigarette smoke-induced genotoxicity.\\nThe experiments described in this report were initiated to\\nevaluate whether AhR-regulated gene expression influences\\nthe grastic toxicity associated with the complex mixture of\\nchemicals in cigarette smoke condensate (CSC).\\nIn the present study we evaluated the ability of CSC to induce\\nAhR-mediated gene transcription in the mouse bepatoma cell\\nline Hepalele? (19). A subeless, Hepa2Dlue, has been stably\\ntransfected with a luciferase reporter she under the control\\nof two DRES.

The usefulness\\nof chromatography to the analysis of the gas phase of\\nciganatte smoke was quickly realized by researchers at\\nthese inboratories [1-5. In 1957, Seligman et al. (6)\\npublished one of the first papers describing the use of gaa\\nchromatography and mass spectrometry in the dater-\\nmination of 17 components in the gas phase of olgaretle\\nsmoke. By 1965, 96 components in the gas phase of\\ncigarette smoke had been isolated and identified [7-14].\\nMuch of the work was dono by Grob (15-21], who readily\\nrealized the necessity of replacing the packed column\\nwith a high performance capillary column developed by\\nGolay [22] and glass capelary columns by Desty et al. [23].\\nPresently, approximately 250 peaks in the gas phase have\\nbeen abserved with close to 200 identified completely or\\npartially. This was accomplished by GC/MS as well as by\\nsolking the gas phase smoke with known compounds in\\norder to determine retention time data [24]. In continuation\\nof efforts to expand our understanding and to profile the\\nproduct, it is felt that the sampling must occur in a fashion\\nsimilar to the way a consumer smokes the cigarette. The\\nfirst step towards this goal is the sampling of whole smoke.\\nAlthough whole smoke does contain nonvolatile compo-\\nnents that cannot be chromatographed practically without\\nDr. Alfred Huntho Publishers\\nderivatization or pyrolysia, there is a substantial number of\\ncomponents having a volatility range between that foundin\\nthe nonvolatio fraction and the gas phase. Therefore, the\\nportion of smoke we are observing, the volatile phase, is\\nmade up of components which are volatile and stable\\nnough to be chromatographed and detected. The volatile\\nphase may be valuable to our product profile data base.\\nespecially when trying to correlate instrumental and\\nsensory discriminative scores, since organoleptically\\nImportant compounds are often found in this volatility\\nrange\\nThe collection of X mililiters of mainstream smoke and\\ncondensation of that sample in a small chromatographle\\nplug white simulating acceptable smoking conditions.\\nposes a practical problem: \"How to smoke the cigarette\\nthrough an X milliter sample loop connected to a sample\\nvalve and then switch the carrier gas to flush the loop and\\ntrap the sample in a liquid nitrogen cooled trap?\" This\\nproblem requiros the heating of all injection hardware, thus\\nsubjecting our dynamic sample to metal surfaces, at\\nelevated temperatures with possibilities for modification\\nor reactions to occur.

The lung and liver DNA samples isulated from\\nA/J mice treated with the various compounds were subjected\\nto acid hydrolysis and the hydrolysates were analyzed for the\\npresence of 154-HPB. No detectable levels were found in\\nthe lung DNA isolated from 15-H14-HPB-treated animals,\\nwhereas significant amounts of [5-'H¦4-HPB were released\\nfrom lung and liver DNA isolated from (5-B)NNK- and\\n(5 HINNKOAc-treated mice. The levels of total binding and\\n[54-HPB released from the globin isolated from these\\nanimals showed a similar trend. That is, low binding levels\\nwere detected in the globin isolated from (5-H14-HPB-\\ntreated animals and significantly higher levels of binding were\\ndelected in the globin from the [5-HINNKOAe- and (5.\\nINNK-treated animals. Comparable findings, were ob-\\ntained in the rat experiments. These studies clearly demon-\\nstrate that methyl hydroxylation of XNK leads to a species\\nthat is capable of reacting covalently with nucleophiles in DNA\\nand protein. Thus, the levels of 4-HPB released from DNA\\nand globin can be attributed to the activation of NNK and\\nnot to the direct binding of 4-HPR.\\nisolated from rats treated with pyridylicitiated.

In order to determine whether 4-HPB released from\\nhemoglobin and DNA is deaved from an adduct(s) formed via\\nNNK activation or resulted from direct busding of 4-HPB to diese\\nmacromolecules, we measured itse levels of 4-14B released from\\nDNA and hemoglobin isolated from rodents treated with (5^^1}|-\\nNNK, (5-³H}4-HP8, or [5-'H]4-jacetoxymethyiniunmino)-1-\\n0-pyridyl)-1-butanene (NNKOAe), die acetylated hydroxymethyl\\nmcbolite of NNK.

Sidman, December 19, 1990\\nABSTRACT la nerve cells, a specialized protein synthetic\\nmachinery is thought to operate in local compartments of\\ndendrites, in particular beneath synaptic junctions, and\\nthereby to facilitate swift adjustments of the postsynaptle\\nprotein repertoire in situ. This notion has been supported by\\nthe identification of polyribosomes and selected mRNAs in\\nthose compartments. In this study, we report the discovery of\\na specific RNA polymerase III transcript to dendrites. This\\nRNA, a noncoding, 152-nucleotide-long, single-gene transcript\\nknown as BC1 RNA, is expressed almost exclusively in the\\nnervous system. In adult rats as well as in immature rats in late\\ndevelopmental stages, BC) RNA has been located in the\\ndendrites and somats of a subset of neurons in the central and\\nperipheral nervous system. The colocalization of BC1 RNA\\nwith dendritic mRNAs and polyribosomes may indicate a\\nrole possibly within the functional unit of a high molecular\\nmass ribonucleoprotein particle-in specific pre- or posttrans-\\nJational processes in postsynaptic compartiments of neurons,\\nThe presence of RNA in dendrites constitutes an important\\nelement of molecular polarity in nerve celis (1-11). RNA is\\nactively transported into dendrites but not into axons of\\ncultured hippocampal neurons (1). In the dentate gyrus,\\npolyribosomes have been detected in postsynaptic dendritic\\ncompartments, frequently in close association with dendritic\\nspines (2-5). Postsynaptic accumulation of polyribosomes\\nhas been shown to be most dramatic during periods of\\ndevelopmental synaptogenesis (4), and it has been proposed\\nthat proteins synthesized on these ribosomes may be in-\\nvolved in the formation, differentiation, and modification of\\nsynapses (2-4).\\nAlthough most neuronal mRNAs seem to be confined to\\nthe perikarya of nerve cells, a small number of miRNAs, all\\nof them coding for dendritic proteins, has recently been\\ndetected in the somatodendritic compartments of neurons in\\nthe rat nervous system. One of them is the mRNA for the high\\nmolecular mass form of microtubule-associated protein 2\\n(MAP2, reis. 6-8), a tubulin-binding protein associated with\\nthe dendritic cytoskeleton (see ref. 12 for a review). Another\\ndendritic mRNA encodes the a-subunit of Ca2+ /calmodulin-\\ndependent protein kinase type 11 (CaM-KII) (9).

Harvard Medical School Huston, MA 02115\\nCommunicated by Bruce M. Albers, National Academy of Sciences, Washington DC. My 12, 1905\\nABSTRACT In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevi\\nsiae, the spindle pole body (SPB) serves as the microtubule-\\norganizing center and is the functional analog of the centros\\nsome of higher organisms. By expressing a fusion of a yeast\\nSPB-associated protein to the dequorca victers green fluores\\ncent protein, the movement of the SPBs in living yeast cells.\\nundergoing mitosis was observed by fluorescence microscopy.\\nThe ability to visualize SPBs in vive has revealed previously\\nunidentified mitotic events. During anaphase, the mitatic\\nspindle has four sequential activitles: alignment at the mothe\\ner-daughter junction, fast elongation, translocation into the\\nhod, and slow clongation. These results indicate that distinct\\nforces act upon the spindle at different times during anaphase.\\nDuring mitosis, chromosome segregation is mediated by the\\nmitotic spindle. The spindle consists of a network of interdig\\nhaung microtubules that emanate from a pair of microtubule+\\norganizing centers (MTOCs). In the budding yeast Saccharo-\\nmyces cereviside, the MTOC, terned the spindle pote hody\\n(SPB), remains embedded in the nuclear envelope as the celi\\nundergoes a closed mitosis (1). Early in the cell division cycle,\\nthe single SPB moves toward the bud site and duplicates (2, 3).\\nNear the end of S phase, the two SPB move apart and form\\na short (1 μm) spindle. The short spindle then localizes to the\\nmother-buc junction (termed the bud neck), and elongation\\ncommences.\\nThe NUF2 gene of yeast encodes a protein that localizes to\\nthe nuclear tace of the SPB (4). Nuf2p contains a large segment\\nof coiled-coil structure, and mutations in this region result in\\ncells arrested with a shortened mitotic spindle and fully\\nreplicated DNA (4). Nul2p is a particularly suitable marker for\\nobserving SPBS in living cells because it remains SPB-\\nassociated throughout the cell cycle, and it can be overex-\\npressed without toxic side effects (4)\\nBecause the mechamums governing SPB movement have yet\\n10 ne determined, we have developed an innovative strategy to\\nobserve its dynames in living cells visualization of a functional\\nfusson between a SPB-associated protein and the Acquorea\\nvictona green fluorescent protein (GFP) (S, 6) GFP has &\\nnumber of advantages as a fluorescent reporter protein in\\nparticular it requires no cofactor for visualization and can be\\nexpressed in a number of heterologous cell types (6).\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nPlasmid Construction.

Animals receiving only 2-AAF or PR do not possess\\nthis new aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The phenotype is\\ncharacterized by the appearance of a new cytosolie isozyme\\nkinetically, electrophoretically and immunochemically\\ndistinct from the normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase iso-\\nzymes and from aldehyde dehydrogenases inducible to\\n2-AAF-induced hepatomas. The new isozyme is NAD-depen-\\ndent, disulfiram-sensitive and cross-reacts with antiserum to a\\nnormal liver aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in several\\nlines of rats by PB. However, the population of unimals used\\nin this study has been shown previously to be non-responsive\\nto aldehyde dehydrogenase induction by dietary PB. Since no\\nanimals receiving only PB express this new isozyme, the ear-\\ncinogen must play a significant role in its induction. More-\\nover, that not all animals receiving carcinogen and promoter.\\npossess the phenotype suggests this carcinogen/promoter in-\\nteraction has a genetic basis.\\nIntroduction\\nWork in our laboratory is directed toward clucidating the\\nmechanisms underlying the expression of a unique aldehyde\\ndehydrogenase phenotype (aldehyde: NAD(P) oxidoreduc\\ntase, H.C. 1.2.1.3 and 1.3.1.5) in hepatomas induced in\\nSprague-Dawley rats by 2-acetylamitofluorene (2-AAF)*\\n(1-5). The phenotype is characterized by an increase in total\\naldehyde dehydrogenase activity due to die appearance of\\nseveral cytosolic isozymes not present in normal liver The\\ntumor isozymes are very active with aromatic aldehyde\\nsubstrates and NADP as coenzyme and have electrophoretic\\nmobilities, isoelectric points and immunochemical properties\\ndistinct from those of normal liver aldehyde dehydrogenases\\n(2-5). The tumor phenotype is not due to reexpression of\\nfetal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (4). To date, we have\\nobserved no significant changes in aldehyde dehydrogenase\\nactivity in normal liver during 2-AAF-induced hepatocarcino-\\ngenesis prior to the appearance of the tumor aldehyde de\\nhydrogenase phenotype.\\nIn normal rat liver, aldehyde dehydrogenase exists as at\\nAuthor to whom all correspondence should be addressed.\\nAbbreviations: 2-AAF. 2-metylaminofluorene, PB. phenobarbital;\\nTCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibetuzo-p-dioxin.\\nIRI.

These isozymes can be differentiated on\\nthe basis of substrate and coenzyme preference, substrate Kin\\nimmunochemical properties and sensitivity to inhibitors.\\nIn addition to these basal isozymes, several aldehyde de\\nhydrogenases can be induced by various xenobiotics in nor-\\nmal ver (8-14). Among these are two very effective pro-\\nmoters of hepatocarcinogenesis, phenobarbital (PB) and\\n2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCCD). PB induces a\\ncytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase in certain genetically-\\ndefined lines and certain strains of rats (8-10,13). A second\\ncytosolic isozyme is inducible by TCDD in both PB-\\nresponsive and non-responsive lines (11 – 13). Although the\\ntumor aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes differ in a number\\nof properties from the TCDD-inducible isozyme, the TCDD-\\ninducible isozyme is immunochemically identical to at least\\none of the tumor isozymes (15). Neither the tumor noi\\nTCDD-inducible isozymes are related to the PB-inducible\\nisozyme (11.15).\\nMaximal induction of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity oc-\\ncurs within 3 days of PB exposure and within 14 days follow-\\ning TCDD exposure (8,11). In as much as some of the\\nhepatomas possessing the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenases\\nhave been induced by a tumor-induction protocol employing\\nPB as a promoter and at least one tumor isozyme and the\\nTCDD-inducible isozyme are immunochemically identical, it\\nwas of interest to determine when the tumor aldehyde de-\\nhydrogenase phenotype is first detectable during the tumor-\\ninduction process. The results of such an experiment indicate\\nthat the tumor aldehyde dehydrogenase phenotype is indeed\\ntumor-specific (6). It is not detectable in any grossly normal\\nliver during or following carcinogen exposure, even in\\nanimals receiving PB as promoter.

    "text": "PREPOSAL for the study of the EFFECTS OF SHEARING STRESS ON THE\\nTRACHEO-BRONCHIAL TREE AND ITS POSSIBLE RELATION TO THE PATHO-\\nGENESIS OF BRONCHOGENIC CARCINOMA AND CHRONIC BRONCHITIS.\\nPaul Hamosh, M. D.\\nAmong the etiological factors which might contribute to the patho-\\ngenesis of bronchogenic carcinoma, mechanical factors received practically\\nno attention. During rapid expiratory flow and especially during coughing,\\npowerful shearing forces are generated in the airways. We have demonstrated\\nthat these forces might cause significant damage to the mucosal layer.\\nThis damage can lead to frequent regeneration leading to metaplasia and\\nultimately maybe malignant changes. Discontinuities in the mucosal layer\\ncan also theoretically lead to increased penetration of carcinogenic sub-\\nstances and even release of additional broncho-constrictor agents (prosta-\\nglandins). Thus, repeated coughing might produce a vicious cycle resulting\\nin permanent damage of the airways. Circumstantial evidence to support\\nthis hypothesis is the fact that present studies indicate that bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma is originating in segmental or some subsegmental bronchi. We\\nhave found by calculation that these sites coincide with the points of\\nmaximum shear. \"Atrophy of tracheal mucosa (also a high shear area)\\nhas been reported.\\nThe experimental approach to the study of the above problem is complex.\\nWe have completed the study in isolated tracheal segments and now we would\\nlike to move on to look at the in vivo situation. Recently a group at\\nOak Ridge developed a model of isolated trachea under the skin of the\\nback in rats. This model could be easily used to study shearing stress\\nbecause of its convenient remoteness from the respiratory system,\\ni.e.\\nit can be manipulated without interfering with breathing. Further research\\ncould be performed by producing an additional animal model in which local-\\nized broncho constriction could be produced surgically and then areas of\\nmajor shearing stress created. A third approach would be computer simulation\\nof superimposed lung disease on a functioning model of the lung in a study\\nof shearing stress distribution in such a model.\\nWe would be excellently equipped to carry out this research for the follow-\\ning reasons:\\n11 We have contributed so far the only study on this subject.\\n2) We have excellent personnel which covers everything from morphology\\nby light microscopy to scanning electron microscopy.\\n3) We have a program and the hardware for running the computer aspect\\nof this project.\\nIn view of the above, the information necessary to prove or disprove\\nthis hypothesis could be obtained at relatively low cost since expenses would\\nbe incurred mostly for technical assistance and supplies; whereas profession-\\nal help and equipment is already available.\\nEnels.

These preparations were annealed and\\ncloned into an M13 phage vector to produce a librery of GRE\\nmutants. Mutations within the synthesized region were iden\\ntified by sequencing phage isolates at random. All of the\\nchemically distinct classes of transition and transversion my-\\ntations have been observed. Statistical considerations indicate\\nthat the library contains all of the possible 90 point substitution\\nmutations within a 30-nucleotide mutagenic target. So far 88 of\\nthese substitutions have been isolated, 74 as single mutants. AU\\nleast two of the three possible single mutants at each of the 30\\npositions have been identified\\nSeveral inethods have been developed for introducing de-\\nfined changes into DNA molecules of known sequence for\\nreview, see ref. 1. The most precise of these is oponucle\\notide-directed mutagenesis (2). which has been used to\\nintroduce single base substitutions at specific positions in\\nDNA sequences as well as specific insertions and deletions.\\nIn fact, the major limitation of the method has been its high\\ndegree of specificity, because the strategies used have usually\\nrequired the synthesis of a different mutagenic oligonucleo\\nbde for each desired mutation. In situations where it is\\nnecessary to produce many mutations throughout a ser\\nquenced region, other methods have been used, such as\\nbisulfite mutagenesis (3) and the linker scanning method (4).\\nThe method of enzymatic nucleotide misincorporation (5)\\nappears to produce a completely random set of substitution\\nmutations. Recently, the potential of oligonucleotides as\\nmutagens has been expended through the use of mutagenic\\noligonucleondes synthesized to contain mixtures of bases at\\nseveral positions within a target sequence (6-9). This allowed\\na number of different mutations to be introduced by using a\\nsingle synthetic oligonucleotide preparation.\\nWe present here a general method for producing and\\nidentifying every possible single base substitution mutation\\nwithin a region. As described below, the method requires\\nsynthesis of each strand of the target sequence only once. To\\ntest the feasibility of the method, we have produced matá-\\ntions within the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) of\\nmouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The GRE resembles\\nan enhancer that can stimulate expression of an adjacent gene\\nin the presence of glucocorticoids (10, 11).

Assays of vanous deletion mutants 02, 13,\\n16-19), combined with results of receptor-DNA footprint.\\nexpenments (14, 15), indicate that a domain of 30 nucleo-\\ntides (positions -360 to -190 relative to the start of tran-\\nscription; see Fig. 1) contains a strong receptor binding site\\nand is critical for activity of the element. We therefore expect\\nthat a combination of in vitro and in vivo essays of the mutants\\nof this domain that we have isolated will yield insights into the\\nsequence specificity of this regulatory element and the\\nmechanism of steroid-mediated regulation of gene expres-\\nsion.\\nThe method relies on automated synthesis of the target\\nsequence in a way that yields a randomly mutagenized\\npreparation. This is achieved by a slight modification of the\\nusual synthetic procedure, in which chains are built stepwise\\nfrom the 3' end by the addition of nucleoside phosphorami-\\ndite monomeric units. Before synthesis begins, each of the\\nfour monomer reservoirs is \"doped\" with a small amount of\\neach of the other three. Incorporation of a Copant molecule\\ninto the synthetic product results in a mutant sequence. Since\\nthe contaminating nucleotides are incorporated at random.\\nthis procedure results in a population of molecules containing\\n0, 1, 2, 3, or more mutations.

The conversion events involved either a subset of the total Ty elements in the genome or\\nthe conversion tract was restricted to a small region of the Ty element. In addition, the observed conversion\\nevents were very infrequently associated with reciprocal exchange.\\nMost individuals within a phylogenetic species have the\\nsamc karyotype. The frequency of spontanceus chromo.\\nsomal alterations, such as translocations, deletions, duplica.\\nHons, and inversions, is usually tow. Chromosomal aberra-\\ntions can be regarded as the product of illegitimate\\nrecombination events. In some cases, the event producing\\nthe altered chromosome appears to be a site-specific type of\\nrecombination (for a review, see reference 9). For example,\\nthe translocations observed in certain non-Burkitt B-cell\\ntumors appear to be the result of errors made during V-D-3\\nJoining in the immunoglobin gene cluster (51). A possible\\nalternative mechanism for the production of chromosomal\\nalterations is homologous recombination between dispersed\\nrepeated genes. Such exchanges have been shown to pro-\\nduce deletions and duplications in higher cucaryotes. For\\nexample, a duplication of a region of the human LDL\\nreceptor gene as the result of a recombination event involv-\\ning repeated Alu elements has been reported previously (30).\\nEn higher cucaryotes, however, no spontaneous transfoca.\\ntions (other than those involved in tumor formation) have\\nbeen analyzed at the level of DNA sequence. It is unclear,\\ntherefore, whether translocations can also involve homolo.\\ngous recombination between dispersed repeats.\\nIn the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosac-\\ncharomyces pombe, recombination between dispersed re-\\nprated genes has been observed in meiosis and mitosis. Such\\nevents have been termed ectopic recombination (31). Both\\nreciprocal and nonreciprocal recombination events have\\nbeen detected (12, 23, 24, 27, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 45, 49, 50];\\nthe nonreciprocal transfer of DNA sequences from one\\nrepeat to another represents a gene conversion event. Most\\nof these studies have involved duplications of genes that are\\nnormally present in a single copy per haploid genome,\\nalthough recombination between naturally occurring repeats\\nhas also been observed.\\nOne surprising feature of these studies is that creiotic\\nrecombination (both gene conversion and crossovers) be-\\nbreen artificially duplicated genes was found to occur at high\\nFrequencies (23, 24, 31).

As with allelic conversion events\\n(17), approximately half of the ectopic conversion events\\nwere associated with reciprocal recombination, producing\\nchromosomal translocations (24, 31).\\nOne of the most abundant dispersed class of repeated\\nsequences in the yeast genone are the Ty elements, which\\nare found in approximately 30 to 50 copies per haploid\\ngenome (40). These elements have a structure similar to that\\nof retroviruses, consisting of a S-kitobase (kb) central ele-\\nment repsilon) that is Bunked by 338-base-pair (bp) direct\\nrepeats (delta elements). Ty elements have been shown to\\ntranspose into target loci at low frequency (about 10*\\nthrough a reverse transcription process (1).\\nSince there are many Ty elements in the genome and since\\n(as described above) duplicated genes on nonhontologous\\nchromosomes have high levels of reciprocal meiotic recom-\\nbination, the relative stability of the yeast karyotype is\\ndifficult to explain. One obvious possibility is that meiotic\\nrecombination between Ty elements is strongly suppressed.\\nYeast strains with a mutation in the EDRI gene have\\nincreased levels of mitotic recombination between delta\\nelements (43). It seems likely that similar mechanisms may\\nexist to reduce the frequency of Ty-Ty recombination in\\nmeiosis. In mitotically dividing cells, the repression of\\nrecombination mediated by the EDRI system is not abso-\\nlute, since both gene conversion events as well as reciprocal\\nrecombination events (involving either Ty elements within\\none chromosome or Ty elements on nonhomologous chro-\\nmosomes) have been observed between Ty elements (4, 7,\\n32. 41). It should be noted, however, that a very efficient\\nsystem that suppresses mitotic exchange between Ty cle-\\nments is probably not necessary, since mitotic exchanges in\\ngeneral are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude less frequent Ran\\nmeiotic exchanges (for a review, see reference 13). Although\\nno systematic study of the frequency of meiotic recombina\\ntion between Ty elements has been done, Roeder (38) found\\na high frequency of unequal reciprocal meiotic recombina-\\ntion between two Ty elements located on chromosome III.\\nAs described below, we measured directly the frequency\\nof meiotic gene conversion and associated reciprocal ex-\\nchange hetween marked Ty elements.

The product of the cdc18 gene is a major\\ndownstream target of cdc 10', and transcription of\\ncdc 18 is activated by cdc10* during passage through\\nSTART. The cdc18* function is required for entry Into\\nS phase. In addition, the product of the cdc 18* gene\\nis part of the checkpoint control that prevents mitosis\\nfrom occurring until S phase is completed. Thus,\\ncdc18 plays a key role in coupling S phase to START\\nand mitosis.\\nIntroduction\\nThe timing of S phase during the cell cycle is closely regu-\\nlated: DNA replication is initiated soon after the coll be-\\ncomes committed to the cell cyclo and must be completed\\nbefore mitocis can take place (reviewed in Forsburg and\\nNurse, 1991; Hartwell and Weinert, 1989: Nurse, 1990;\\nReed, 1992). In this paper we identify a gene that plays.\\nessential roles in the mechanisms that control entry into\\nS phase and coordinate S phase with mitosis.\\nIn the yeasts, passage through the commitinent control\\npoint START restricts the developmental fatus open to the\\ncell and determines the cell cycle timing of S phase Once\\npast START, a developmental program is set in motion\\nthat brings about $ phase and, subsequently, mitosis. In\\nthe fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two gono\\nfunctions, cdc2' and cdc10, have been demonstrated to\\nbe required al START (Aves et al., 1985; Brook et al.,\\n1991; Nurse and Bisselt, 1981; Nurse et al., 1976). The\\ncdc?* gene encodes the p3c protein kinase that is also\\nrequired later in the cell cycle to initiate mitosis (reviewed\\nin Nurse, 1990). The procise molecular ralo of p34* at\\nSTART remains uncertain, since the protein kinase activity\\nof the protein is low in 01 and potential substrates for\\nphosphorylation have not yet been unambiguously identi-\\nlied. The other START gene, cdc10', encodes ar 85 kd\\nprotein (385; Aves et al. 1985) that appears to be an\\nessential component of a recently identified transcription\\nlactor complex that activates specific genes at the begin.\\nning of S phase (Lowndes et al., 1991, 1992b).\\nIn the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, over\\n15 genes involved in DNA replication are periodically ex\\npressed in late G1 (reviewed in Johnston and Lowndes,\\n1992; Morrill et al., 1993). Many of these gones encode\\nenzymatic components of the replication machinery (o.g..\\nPOLI, POL3, PB1, PRI2, etc.), while others encode pro-\\nteins thought to participate in the initiation of S phase.\\nsuch as CDC6 and 08F4. The promoter regions of all these\\ngenes contain the sequence ACCCGT or a closely related\\nsequence, called the Mlul cell cycle box (MCB) olement\\n(Gordon and Campbell, 1991; Lowndes et al., 1991; Mcln-\\ntosh et al., 1991; Verma el al., 1991). This MCB element\\nis sufficient to confer cell cycle control on heterologous\\npromoters (Lowndes et al., 1991). An MCB binding activity\\ncalled DSC1 (or MCBF; Lowndes et al., 1991: Verma el\\nal., 1991) that is prosent transiently in fate Gt has been\\nidentified in crudo yeast cell extracts, consistent with a\\nrole in the periodic activation of transcription. The Swis\\nprotein is an essential comporrent of DSC1 (Lowndes et\\nal., 1992a; Dirick et al., 1992) and of a second cell cycle-\\nregulated DNA binding activity called SBF (Andrews and\\nHerskowitz, 1989a, 1989b; Taba et al., 1991). SBF, which\\nalso contains the SWi4 protoin, recognizes a sequence\\nCACGAAA (the SCB element) found in the promoter re-\\ngons of a different set of genes expressed in late G1,\\nincluding the HO, CLNT, and CLN2 genes (Fernandez-\\nSarabia et al., 1992, Nasmyth and Dirick, 1991. Ogas et\\nal., 1991; Primig et al., 1992; Wittenberg et al., 1990). Cells\\nlacking the SW14 and SW16 proteins arrest hoteroga-\\nneously in the cell cycle both before and alter S phase\\n(Breeden and Nasmyth, 1987a; Ogas et al., 1991), indicat\\ning that disruption of these two systems does not simply\\nresult in cells arresting in G1 at START.\\nTranscriptional control of S phase-specific ganes cc-\\ncurs in the fission yeast S. pombe, but involves a more\\nrestricted set of genes than in S. cerevisiae. One such\\ngene is cdc22\", which encodes a subunit of ribonucleotide\\nreductase (Gordon and Fantes, 1986). Other genes encod\\ning enzymes directly involved in DNA synthesis are ex-\\npressed throughout the cell cycle (White et al., 1986). The\\npromoter region of cde22* contains several MCB elements\\nthat are sufficiant to confer cell cycle-regulated expres\\nsion (Lowndes ot al., 1992b). An MCB-specific binding ac-\\ntivity analogous to DSC1 has been identified in extracts\\nof fission yoast and contains the product of the cacto\"\\ngene (Lowndes et al., 1992b), pa5 shares about 2546\\namino acid sequence identity with the SW4 and SW16\\nproteins (Breeden and Nasmyth, 1987; Primig et al.,\\n1992; Tanaka et al., 1992), although gene exchange ex-\\nperiments have failed to demonstrate that cdc10 can re-\\nplace SW/4/SW16 or vice versa. Thus, the MC8-directed\\ntranscriptional activation system is similar in two widely\\nclvergent yeast species. Since mutants of the cdc10' gene",

Oocytes microinjected with \"cloned\"\\nmRNA have been used to gain insight into biophysical and pharmacologic properties of voltage-\\ngated K+, Na+, and Ca channels.

Each megakaryocyte\\ncontained about 500 times as much Factor V as is in a platelet\\n(0.234±0.180 g/10 platelets). The content of Factor V\\nantigen in guinea pig plasma was greader (27.0±3.0 µg/ml)\\nthan that of Factor V antigen in human plasma (11.120.4 pg/\\nmt. In contrast, human platelets contain ninefold more Factor\\nVantigen (2.01 1.09 µg/10° platelets) than do guinea pig\\nplatelets. The Factor V coagulant activities in the guinea pig\\nwere 2.8520.30 U/ml plasma, 0.022±0.012 U/10' platelets,\\nand 0.032±0.03 U/10° megakaryocytes, compared with human\\nvalues of 0.98.21.02 U/tal plasma and 0.124.20.064 15/10\\nplatelers.

The megakaryocytes were in-\\ncubated with Smethionine, and radiolabeled intracellular\\nproteins purified were on a human anti-Factor V immunoaffinity\\ncolumn. The purified protein exhibited Factor V coagulant\\naclivity and neutralized the inhibitory activity of a rabbit anti-\\nhuman Factor V antibody, which suggests that megakaryocyte\\nFactor is functionally and antigenically intact. These results\\nindicate that Factor V is synthesized by guinea pig nægakar-\\nyocytes. Nonetheless, megakaryocyte Factor V was more slowly\\nactivated by thrombla and in the absence of calcium was more\\nstable after activation than was plasma Factor Va.

Both forms of Fictor V were substrates for thrombin.\\nPossible explanations for the higher molecular weight and\\ndifferent thrombin sensitivity and stability observed are that u\\nprecursor of Factor V was isolated or that the megakaryocyte\\nFactor V had not been fully processed before isolation.\\nIntroduction\\nFactor V is a plasma glycoprotein that functions as a nouen-\\nzymatic cofactor accelerating the conversion of prothrombin\\nto thrombin by Factor Xa. For blood coagulation or clot\\nformation initiated either by the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway\\nto proceed at a physiologic rate, Factor V is required. The site\\nof prothrombin conversion in vivo is probably the platelet\\nsurface membrane. Miletich et al. (1) demonstrated that the\\nbinding of Factor Xa to platelets resulted in a 300.000-fold\\nincrease in the enzymatic activity of Factor Xa in converung\\nprothrombin to thrombie and required Factor V (2) In\\nsupport of this concept, patients with congenital Factor V\\ndeliciency have decreased Factor Xa binding sites on their\\nplatelets. The ongin of Factor V associated with platelets has\\nthus occasioned considerable interest. Bovine Factor V in the\\nplastna after thromain activation binds to bovine platelets with\\na of 3.4 x 10 M (3), and studies in our laboratory (4)\\ndemonstrated a requirement for Cat in the physiological\\nrange for binding of bovine Factor V to human platelets.\\nMoreover, Kane and Majerus (5) kave observed simtar ister-\\nactions between human Factor V and human platelets. How\\never, Factor V may also arise from an intracellular location in\\nplatelets since human platelets separated by gel filtration do\\nnot have significant Factor V activity but develop coagulant\\nactivity upon repeated freezing and thawing (6). Studies from\\nbis laboratory show that both human (7) and bovine (8)\\nplatelets contain Factor in the a-granules where it can be\\nreleased by coilagen. Thrombin can also release Factor V from\\nhuman platelets (9), where it would be in the form of Factor\\nVa and thus would exhibit high affinity binding to the surface\\nmembrane. Since platelets cannot syalesize protein. platelet\\nFactor V might originate from plasma or be synthesized by\\nthe precursor of platelets, the megakaryocyte.\\nIn this report. Factor V in isolated guinea pig megakaryo-\\ncytes was quantified by a competitive enzyme-linked imme\\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) assay by use of a cross-reacting\\nrabbit monospecific antibody to hunian Factor V (10) Factor\\nV was visualized in megakaryocytes by cytoimmunofluores\\ncence.

Phosphorylation is a major post-trauslational regulatory mechanism, and plays a key role in transauc.\\ntion of mitogenie signads in cell proliferation. The role of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in regalating\\nthe activities of a multiprotein DNA polymerase complex was examined. Treatment of the HeLa cell malu-\\nprotein DNA polymerase a with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase resulted in the activation of DNA polyin-\\nence a and DNA primase but had no effect on deoxyribonuclease and primer-recognition proteins. A protein\\nkuse co-parified with the multiprotein DNA polymerase o and was partially purified from fieLa cells. The par-\\ntially purified kinase was active in phosphorylaung dephosphorylated polymerase a and used casein and nistones\\nas exogenous substrates. This study demonstrates that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation may have modulated\\nthe activities of DNA replicative enzymes and suggests a role for specific phosphatases and kinases in this pro-\\ncess.\\nCell proliferation is a tightly regulated process in\\nnormal cells. Abnormal cell proliferation is the hall.\\nmark of the tumorigenic phenotype and is a result of\\nrelaxation or lack of growth control. Many environ-\\nmental signals such as cell to cell contact or exiracet-\\nlular growth factors exert their effects by regulating\\ncell proliferation. The ability of normal cells to re-\\nspond to extracellular or mitogenic signals depends\\non the capacity of the cells to couple primary prolif\\ncration signals to the processes of DNA synthesis and\\ncell cycle control. It is recognized that phosphoryla\\ntion plays a central part in the transduction of\\ninitogenic signals. The cellular pathways, however,\\nthat link extracellular signals to DNA synthesis are\\nnot understood yet. In an attempt to understand\\nthese cellular pathways, we have investigated the role\\nof phosphorylation in regulating enzymes involved in\\nDNA synthesis.\\nModulation of enzyme activities by phosphoryl\\nalion-dephosphorylation has been demonstrated for\\na number of proteins.

This\\nis in contrast to the situation in higher eukaryotes in which the sequence AADAAA is known to be crucial to\\nproper 3'-end formation. The AAUAAA hexanucleotide is found upstream of the poly(A) site in some but not\\nall yeast genes. One of these is the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase, ADII2. Deletion or a double point\\nmutation of the AAUAAA has only a small effect on the efficiency of the reaction, and in contrast to the\\nmammalian system, it is most likely not operating as a major processing signal in the yeast cell. However, we\\nisolated point mutations which reveal that a region located approximately 80 nucleotides upstream of the\\npoly(A) site plays a critical role in either transcription termination, polyadenylation, or both. These mutations\\nrepresent the first point mutations in yeasts which significantly reduce the efficiency of 3'-end formation.\\nThe formation of the 3′ ends of eukaryotic mRNAs\\ninvolves several steps, including termination of transcrip\\ntion, cleavage of precursor RNA. and addition of poly(A). In\\nhigher cukaryotes, it is known that termination of transcrip-\\ntion by RNA polymerase II occurs downstream from the end\\nof the mature mRNA. The actual end of the mRNA is\\nproduced by cleavage of the primary transcript and the\\nsubsequent addition of about 200 adenylate residues (for\\nreviews, see references 30 and 36). The relationship between\\ntermination of transcription and RNA processing is not well\\nunierstood, although it appears that termination requises\\nvalid RNA-processing sites (13, 17, 48). Polyadenylation has\\nbeen studied both in vivo and in vitro in mammalian cells\\nFrom these studies, it is clear that sequences on the precur-\\nsor RNA as well as several factors, including specificity\\nfactors, cleavage factors, and a poly(A) polymerase, are\\nrequired for proper 3'-end formation (10, 11, 18. 31, 44). The\\ngisráðling sequence which is most highly conserved in meta-\\n20ans is the hexanucleotide AATAAA. usually found within\\n30 nucleotides (n) 5 of the polyadenylation site. This\\nsequence is clearly required for assembly of the processing\\ncomplex and for cleavage and polyadenylation of the mRNA\\nprecursor (30, 36). In contrast, the lack of conservation of\\nthis sequence is apparent in a survey of gene sequences from\\nthe yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as higher plant\\nspecies (26). In yeasts, this sequence appears at the 3' end of\\nIRRNA in approximately 50% of yeast genes (24a). Several\\nother consensus sequences have been proposed for yeast\\n3'-end formation (23. $1), but none are as conserved as the\\nAATAAA signal found in metazoans. Therefore, although\\nall yeast mRNAs are polyadenylated and a variety of pre-\\ncursors are accurately cleaved in yeast extracts (1, 7, 8), the\\nsignals directing these events are not clear.\\nThe relationship between transcription termination and\\nRNA processing in yeasts is also undefined.

Maximal RPP tensions were examined under length-clamped conditions\\nand compared with the steady-state forces obtained when further increases in (Ca), did not further\\nincrease force and to the tensions recorded at the point of saturation of force when similarly\\nlength-clamped muscles were subjected to caffeine-induced tetanization. The results show that the\\ncalculated maximal twitch tension achieved with RPP is comparable to the 25-35 g/mm² observed in\\nintact single skeletal muscle fibers. The study also shows that the beat-to-beat decay of the potentiated\\ncontraction is exponential. While the amount of the constant fractional beat-to-beat decay is a function\\nof [Ca, it is not influenced by length. During the decay of potentiation, the ratio of the potentiation\\nof any heat divided by that of the previous beat is a constant, called (x). With certain assumptions,\\nit is shown that (x) is a measure of the fraction of activator calcium taken up by the sarcoplasmic\\nreticulum in each beat and, in the steady state, the fraction of activator calcium that comes from the\\nsarcoplasmile reticulum. The (x) amounted to 33%, 50%, and 65% when (Cal, was 1.25, 2.50, and\\n5.0 nM, respectively. Thus, at 1.25 mM [Ca), some two thirds of the total calcium required to\\nactivate the myofilaments comes from the extracellular compartment during excitation and only one\\nthird is contributed via release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

In order to quantuy metabolite\\nconcentrations using \"P NMR spectroscopy an external reference of hexamethyl phos\\nphorousinamide was used.

C736-C742, 1992.-To investigate the basis of interections\\nbetween nerves and mast cells, we tested the actions of the\\nneuropeptide substance P (SP) on whole cell current character-\\nistics of RBL-2H3 cells (homologous to mucosal mast cells).\\nControl RBI, cells showed a K+-dependent inwardly rectified\\ncurrent. SP (10 M) caused transient, frequently repetitive\\nincreases in current amplitude, which at a membrane potential\\n(V) of 80 mV rose by -1,020.0 ± 223.4 pA after SP applica.\\ntion compared with -6.8 ± 1.7 pA for control. This response\\nwas characterized by a lag phase of 102 16 s. Seventeen\\npercent of cells showed spontaneous transients in the current\\namplitude from the beginning of the recording. After SP admin-\\nistration, the amplitude of these transients increased by 6.3 ±\\n2.0-fold Responses to SP were mimicked by the application of\\nionomycin. For both SP and ionomycin, there was a dose de\\npendency of the lag phase. Removal of extracellular calcium\\nabolished the response for 10 M SP but not for 6.6 x 10-6M\\nionomycin. During current transients, the whole cell current\\nhad both inward and outward rectified components with the\\nzero current V shifted from -87.3 ± 3.2 mV at control to -10.8\\n±1.7 mV. We compare the SP-evoked current responses in\\nmucosal-type mast cells with those described in connective tis\\nsue type\\nelectrophysiology, patch clanp; neurotransmitter; ncoroimus\\nnology; mast cells; calcium ionophores ionomiyem\\nMAST CELLS (MC) and neurons releasing neuropeptides\\nsuch as substance P (SP) may interact with each other\\nand could therefore constitute a functional unit (see Ref.\\n27). This hypothesis is based on the evidence that phys-\\niological and pathological processes are modulated by\\nboth of these elements: some specific examples are ion\\ntransport in the intestine and traches (6, 24), skin in-\\nflammation (7), and bronchoconstriction (19). Because\\ntwo of the major MC phenotypes (mucosal MC and con-\\nnective tissue MC) significantly differ in a number of\\ncytochemical and physiological properties (2), any con-\\nsideration of nerve-MC interactions must specify the\\nMC type involved. In the intestine, morphological stud-\\nies have shown a close and consistent spatial relation-\\nship between mucosal MC and SP-containing nerve fi\\nbers in the lamina propria of both rats and humans (27).\\nAssociation between SP-containing nerves and connec-\\ntive tissue-type MC has also been described in the rat\\ndiaphragm and mesentery (26). In vitro, SP has been\\nshown to be a secretagogue for isolated peritoneal and\\nmucosal MC (8, 25).\\nThe above findings of structural and functional\\ngrounds for nerve-MC interactions constitute a strong\\ncase in support of the initial hypothesis that MC\\nand nerves may be in communication. However, there\\nare reports that question the role of the MC in SP-\\ndependent neurogenic inflammation in the skin (9). Ad-\\n0736\\n0363-6243/92 $2.00 Copyright\\nditionally, the issue is complicated by the great variabil-\\nity in the responsiveness of different MC types to SP\\nin vitro (5).\\nThis indicates the importance of studies at the cellu\\nlar level on the action of SP on different types of MC.\\nElectrophysiological patch-clamp recordings have been\\nperformed on rat peritoneal mast cells (PMC), which\\nbelong to the connective tissue type of MC (20). These\\nshowed that SP activates PMC by triggering specific\\nionic conductances. However, there is no information on\\nSP action on the electrical characteristics of the mucosal\\nMC membrane. Because it is established that connective\\ntissue and mucosal-type MC differ significantly in their\\npossible that their response to SP might also be differ\\nelectrophysiological properties when at rest (10), it is\\nent. To answer this question, we performed whole cell\\npatch-clamp recordings on SP-stimulated RBL-2H3\\ncells, a line of rat basophilic leukemia cells that is ho-\\nmologous to mucosal MC (23). Although stimulus-secre-\\ntion coupling is well characterized in RBL-2H3 cells\\n(18), there is no information on SP action.\\nIn this, we found SP as the first known external stim\\nulus capable of activating whole cell current in the\\nmucosal MC type. We characterized this current re-\\nsponse, pointing out similarities and differences to the\\npreviously presented action of SP on the connective\\ntissue MC (20).

Mutations in ADA2 reduced the activity of\\nGAL4-VP16 and GCN4 in vivo. ede2 mutant extracts\\nexhibited normal basal transcription, but were defec-\\ntive in responding to GAL4-VP16, GCN4, or the dA:dT\\nactivator. Strikingly, the mutant extract responded like\\nwild type to GAL4-HAP4. We conclude that ADA2 po-\\ntentiates the activity of one class of acidic activation\\ndomain but not a second class.\\nIntroduction\\nTranscription of eukaryotic genes often requires sites that\\nact el great distances from the promoter, termed en-\\nhancers in mammalian colls (Banerjl et al., 1981; Moreau\\net al., 1981) and UASS in yeast (Guarente et al., 1982).\\nEnhancers or UASS are bound by transcriptional activator\\nproteins that contain two functional domains, one that dic-\\ntales DNA binding, and a second that activates transcrip-\\ntion (Bront and Plashne. 1925). The activation domains of\\nseveral yeast activators are characterized by a high con-\\ntent of acidic amino acids (Hope and Struhl, 1986; Ma and\\nFlashne, 1987a) Activation domains from metazoans ere\\nof several classes, including acidic, glutemine rich, and\\nproline rich. The acidic activators, such as yeast GAL4,\\nwill activate transcription in many eukaryotic organisms.\\nincluding mammals (Ptashne, 1988). Thus, the mecha\\nnism by which acidic activation domains function must\\nbe conserved in most or all eukaryotes. Metazoan acidic.\\nactivators can work in yeast, while nonacidic activators.\\nsuch as the glutamine-rich activator, Sp1 (Courey and\\nTjian, 1989), appear not to function in yeast 18. Piña and\\nL. Guarento, unpublished data).\\nA central question in eukaryotic transcription is how acti-\\nvators can transmit their signal to the generaltranscription\\nfactors that comprise the transcription initiation complex.\\neven when the activator binds to DNA at significant dis\\ntances from the initiation site. Several mechanisms have\\nbeen proposed for activation at a distance. In ons model,\\nactivators are thought to prevent the repressive effect of\\nhistones on promoters. In vitro studies show that the mag-\\nnitude of activation is actually increased if the transcription\\nreaction is carried out in competition with the assembly of\\nthe DNA template into chromatin (Workman et al., 1991:\\nLaybourne and Kadonaga, 1991). This increase in the\\nmagnitude of activation is due to a strong repression of the\\nbasal level of the in vitro transcription reaction by chroma\\nlin. In yeast cells, a reduction in the synthesis of histones\\nH3 and H4 results in the partial activation of several cellu\\nJar genes (Han and Grunstein, 1989). These in vitro and in\\nvivo studies suggest that histones are required to repress\\nbasal transcription to a very low level and that acidic activa.\\ntion domains can counteract this repression.\\nHowever, activators are also capable of functioning by\\na mechanism that does not involve histones. In vitro, even\\nwhen the DNA template has not been assembled into chro\\nmatin, activation is still robust. This fact has been shown\\nclearly in both mammalian and yeast in vitro systems using\\nthe GAL4-VP16 fusion protein (Sadowski et al., 1998) in\\nwhich the acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex\\nvirus protein. VP16 (Triezenberg et al., 1988. Gerster and\\nRoeder. 1988; O'Hare et al., 1988; Preston et al., 1988),\\nis fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (Johnston\\nand Dover, 1987).\\nMost models for activation that do not involve chromatin\\ninvoke protein-protein interactions between activators\\nbound at UASs and general factors bound at the TATA\\nbox, with the looping out of intervening DNA (Plashnė,\\n1988). These general factors include the TATA box-bind-\\ning protein (TBP) in the TFIID fraction, as well as TFIIA, -8.\\n-E, -F. -G, -K, -1, -J, and RNA polymerase II. In the absence\\nof any activator, the general factors will carry out basal\\ntranscription in vitro (Matsul et al., 1980). The function of\\nT8P in the basal reaction is also conserved across species.\\nboundaries. The yeast TBP has been purified by virtue of\\nIts ability to substitute for the mammalian TBP traction in\\nthis basal reaction (Buratowski et al., 1988. Cavallini et al.,\\n1988). Because the general factors bind to the TATA box-\\ninitiation region of the promoter in an ordered pathway\\n(Buratowski et al., 1989), any one of these factors could be\\nthe target of activators. In fact, chromatographic studies\\nindicated a direct interaction between the acidic activation\\ndomain of VP16 and TBP (Stringer et al., 1990, Ingles et\\nal., 1991). A separate study concluded that a potentially\\nstronger interaction oxists between VP16 and TFIIB (Lin\\nand Green, 1991).

Ellis\\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Wake Forest University Medical Center, Whiston-Salem, North Carolina 27157\\nReceived August 11, 1995; Revised Manuscript Received October 16, 1995\\n0\\nABSTRACT: The two components, AhpF and AlpC. of the Salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide\\nreductase enzyme system have been overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli for investigations\\nof their catalytic properties. Recombinant proteins were isolated in high yield (25-33 mg per liter of\\nbacterial culture) and were shown to impart a high degree of protection against killing by cumere\\nhydroperoxide to the host E. col cells. We have developed quantitative enzymatic assays for AhpF\\nalone and for the combined AhpF/AhpC system which have allowed us to address such issues as substrate\\nspecificity and inhibition by thioi reagents for each protein. All assays gave identical results whether\\noverexpressed S. typhimurium proteins from E. coli or proteins isolated directly from S. typhimurium\\nwere used. Anaerobic hydroperoxide reductase assays have demonstrated that cumene hydroperoxide,\\nethyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide can all be reduced by the combined enzyme system. AhpF\\npossesses multiple pyridine nucleotide-dependent activities (5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)\\nreductase, oxidase, transhydrogenase, and, in the presence of AhpC, peroxide reductase activities). Although\\nAlpF can use either NADH or NADPH as the electron donor for these activities. NADH is the preferred\\nreductant (Knapp of AhpF for NADH was more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for NADPH\\nwhen analyzed using DTNB reductase assays). Thiol-modifying reagents react readily with each reduced\\nprotein, leading to complete loss of hydroperoxide and DTNB reductase activites. In contrast, thiel\\nmodification of reduced AhpF does not affect transhydrogenase or oxidase activities. These data provide\\nthe first direct evidence for a catalytic mechanism for peroxide reduction involving redox-active disulfides\\nwithin each protein.\\nProtection of aerobic organisms from the toxic and\\ndamaging effects of oxygen is conferred by a wide variety\\nof enzymes which, in bacterial systems at least, can be\\ncoordinately regulated through redox-sensitive transcriptional\\nfactors (Storz et al., 1990; Far & Kogoma. 1991; Shigenuga\\net al., 1994; Sies, 1991). Using bacterial mutants altered in\\ntheir OxyR-regulated stress responses, Ames and co-workers\\nidentified a glutathione-independent peroxidase system in\\nEscherichia coli and Sabmonella typhimuriton with a protec-\\ntive role in limiting oxygen-linked DNA damage (Chosiman\\net al. 1985; Storz et al., 1987). Subsequent studies allowed.\\nidentification of the two proteins which comprise this\\nperoxidase system as a 57 kDa flavoprotein (AhpF, formerly\\ndesignated F52a) and a 21 kDa protein lacking a chro-\\nmephoric cofactor (AhpC, formerly designated C22). Al-\\nthough AhpF and AlpC were readily separated during\\npurification, both were required for the catalysis of NADH-\\nand NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of\\nhydroperoxide substrates to their corresponding alcohols.\\nFollowing the cloning of the alpCF locus (Storz et al.,\\n1989; Tartaglia et al., 1990), inspection of the deduced amino\\nacid sequence of AhpF allowed clear identification of this\\nflavoprotein as the second known member of the thioredoxin\\nThis research was supported by NIH Grant GM-51189 and Council\\nfor Tobacco Research Scholar Award Number SA006 to 1.

The patients with heart failure had significantly (p < 0.01) more cir-\\nculating platelet aggregates than the normal volunteers. During sodium nitroprusside infusion, the oumber of\\ncirculating platelet aggregates declined to normal fevels and in vitro platelet aggregation responses to epineph-\\nrine and adenosine diphosphate were also suppressed significantly (p < 0.01). This was associated with a 30%\\ndecline in systemic vascular resistance and 28% increase in cardiac output. In other in vitro experiments.\\nsodium nitroprusside was found to have direct, dose-related platelet aggregation inhibitory actions. This study\\nsuggests that an increase in vasculur resistance in certain heart failure patients may in part be related to an in-\\ncrease in circulating platelet aggregates.

ISHAC, BIN GAO.\\nAND LIU JIANG\\nDepartments of Pharmacology & Toxicology and Medicine\\nMedical College of Virginia\\nVirginia Commonwealth University\\nRichmond, Virginia 23295\\nCatecholamines control a wide variety of metabolic processes in the liver, including\\nkey steps in carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Of the multiple\\nsubtypes of adrenergic receptors (AR) that have been identified by pharmacological\\nmeans as well as by molecular cloning, two subtypes have major roles in the control of\\nhepatic functions in the rat: calcium-linked ogAR and cAMP-linked BAR. The\\nmost extensively studied metabolic effect of catecholamines in the liver is glycogeno!-\\nysis and the subsequent release of ghicose, brought about by activation of the\\nrate-limiting enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase. Phosphorylase activation by catechol-\\namines can occur both through AR and BAR.'\\nIn addition to their short-term metabolic effects, catecholamines also influence\\nhepatocyte growth and differentiation: they increase hepatic DNA synthesis and are\\ninvolved in the early phases of the regenerative response after hepatic injury or\\npartial hepatectomy. The mammalian liver displays unusual plasticity in that it can\\nfully regenerate after extensive tissue loss or injury. This regenerative response is\\npreceded by a temporary dedifferentiation of liver cells, characterized by the loss of\\nliver-specific functions and gene products, such as the synthesis of albumin and\\ntransferrin, and the paralle) rapid emergence of growth-related gene products, such\\nas the protooncogenes c-myc, c-jun, c-fos, and h-ras Adrenergic receptors also\\ndisplay a unique form of plasticity, best exemplified by studies of hepatic glycogenol-\\nysis in the rat. Although in the normal, adult, male rat this response is mediated\\nexclusively by AR, after partial hepatectomy the same response is rapidly\\nconverted to a predominantly BAR-mediated event. Interestingly, a similar conver-\\nsion from oto B2-type response occurs in a number of other conditions, including\\nglucocorticoid deficiency, hypothyroidism, toxin-induced liver regeneration, malig-\\nnant transformation, cholestasis, fetal versus adult state, and dissociation of\\nhepatocytes by enzymatic digestion. 10-14 In many of these conditions, a correspond-\\ning decrease in the expression of AR and increase in the expression of BAR have\\nalso been noted.612-17 Furthermore, the effects of other glycogenolytic hormones\\nacting through calcium, such as vasopressin, or acting though CAMP, such as\\nglucagon, were either unaffected or changed in a different direction than the\\ncorresponding AR response.\" This strongly suggests that the conversion from cher to\\nPadrenergic control of glycogenolysis is related to corresponding inverse changes in\\nthe expression of the AR and BAR genes,167 although it is clear that additional\\nmechanisms, such as selective changes in the coupling of AR and BAR to their\\nrespective G-proteins, or changes in G-protein expression are also involved.\\nBecause cellular dedifferentiation appears to be a common denominator among the\\n261",

Many of the\\nstudies used nose-only exposure systems, whereas others simply used large whole-body chambers. Smoke-induced epithelial hyper-\\ntrophy, hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia were reported in the conducting airways in most of the studies, along with increased\\nnumbers of intra-alveolar macrophages that were occasionally associated with alveolar metaplasia. Lung adenomas and adenocarci-\\nnomas were repented in only a few of the studies.

The\\npresent review was performed to verify whether the mea-\\nsured response to cigarette smoke in redents reflects the\\nstrong epidemiological findings in human smokers (19,\\n31%\\nThis paper is a critical review of the scientific literature\\nrelating to the pulmonary pathology of rats and mice ex-\\nposed by inhalation to cigarette smoke. There is a large\\namount of published literature on this subject, so for\\nspace reasons only a selection of the major papers is pre-\\nsented: the reviewed findings are similar to those in pa-\\npers not so selected. Although there are numerous reports\\non smoke inhalation studies with other small animals.\\n(e.g., hamsters and rabbits) and larger animals (e.g., dogs\\nand primates), these species will be considered in future\\nreviews.

The use of biomarkers is increasing both in acute and chronic discase epidemiology, but the\\nrationale for their introduction is not always firmly established (e.g., when and how their use is scientifically\\njustifiable and cost effective).\\nThe use of biomarkers should be considered within the context of causal models in epidemiology, and of\\nthe intertwining of causation and pathogenesis. Unlike infectious diseases, for cancer and cardiovascular\\ndisease external \"necessary\" causes have not been identified. Thus, the classification of cancer and other\\nchronic diseases cannot be based on unequivocal criteria such as the \"etiologie\" classification of infectious\\ndiseases. As lar as morphology is concerned, \"neoplasia\" and \"anaplasia\" are attributes of cancer that connot\\nbe defined in a straightforward way. Tissue pathologies are minimal and difficult to differentiate from normal\\ntissue in some cancers but are obvious in others. Fren a mechanistic point of view, unless molecular biology.\\ndiscovers specific mechanistic steps in carcinogenesis, which indicate the existence of \"accessary\" events in\\ncarcinogenesis, we cannot adopt an unequivocal definition of cancer. The potential contribution of biomarkers\\nto the elucidation of the pathogenetic process should be considered in the light of such uncertainties.\\nThere is a range of indications for biomarkers, from the use of very specific measurements aimed at single\\nmolecules, to measurements indicating cumulative exposure to agents with the same mechanism of action.\\nThe potential uses of markers in chronic disease epidemiology include (1) exposure assessment in cases in\\nwhich traditional epidemiologie tools are insufficient (particularly for low downs and low risks); (2) multiple\\nexposures or mixtures, in which the aim is to disentangle the etiologic role of single agents; (3) estimation of\\nthe total burden of exposure to chemicals having the same mechanistic target; (4) investigation of pathogenetic\\nmechanisms, and (5) study of individual susceptibility (eg, metabolic polymorphism, DNA repair), | Clas\\nEPIS-MIDI 49:9:951-956, 1996.\\nKEY WORDS.

Examples\\ninclude DNA adducts (internal dose), oncogene mutations and\\nchromaseme translocations (purative “early” (response), and theta-\\nbolic polymorplasin and DNA repair (susceptibility).

This procedore includes an initial selection on\\na density gradient of\\npproximately the complete den-\\nsity range of rat lung ATU cells. Subsequently, to exclude\\nconturinating macrophages and lymphocytes from this\\nfraction, the authors have exploited the fact that the con\\ntaminating cells have leukocyte common antigen (LC)\\non their surfaces, whereas the AT cells do not Our pro-\\ncedure yields 210' ATH cells per rat in a fraction which\\nis 90% pure; the cells are inmediately available for bio-\\nchemical or pharmacologic analysis and represent s\\n90-95% recovery of the ATI cells loaded onto the den\\nsity gradient. The cells retain their in vivo ntorphologic\\ncharacteristics, including their polarity. (Am J Pathol\\n1986. 122:92-100)\\nPULMONARY alveolar Type 1 (ATH) cells synthesize\\nsurfactant and, prior to secretion, store it intracellu-\\nlarly in tamellar bodies. Surfactant is a complex of\\nlipids and proteins which, after it is secreted, coats the\\ninterface between the air and the cellular components\\nin pulmonary alveoli and lowers the surface tension so\\nthat the alveoli can be expanded during inhalation.*¨*\\nPerturbations of this system such as in infants with re-\\nspiratory distress syndrome can lead to death. ATD\\ncells also apparently function in adult animals as pro-\\ngenitors for the cells which replace damaged alveolar\\nType! (ATI) cells. It is important to learn more about\\nthe biochemistry and pharmacology of the AT cell\\nwith respect to these two functions, but this is difficult\\nto do in situ because the lung is composed of more than\\n40 types of cells.\" The availability of a pure popula-\\ntion of ATI cells is therefore desirable, so that the bio-\\nchemistry and pharmacologic responses of these cells\\ncan be analyzed.\\nThe ideal isolation procedure would collect all ATII\\ncells, regardless of their synthetic or developmental\\nstate. Such differences could introduce variations in cel-\\nlular parameters, such as density or size, which are the\\nbasis for commonly used cell separation procedures.\\nIn fact, the density mange covered by ATII cells is broad\\nand overlaps ranges which include lymphocytes and\\nsome of the less dense macrophuges. Some isolation\\nprocedures, therefore, in the interest of punty and at\\nthe expense of the more dense ATII cells, select a den-\\nsity range which excludes most macrophages.*** Some\\nisolation procedures subsequently or solely rely on\\ndifferential adhesion in tissue culture to remove the re-\\nmaining macrophages and the lymphocytes. The use\\nof tissue culture introduces a potential problem, in thai\\nthe biochemical and pharmacologic features of the cells\\nmay change under in vitro conditions.\\nWe have developed an isolation procedure that in-\\ncludes an initial selection of almost the complete đen.\\nsity range of the ATII cells.

In addition,\\nkining act on endothelial cells to cause the release of prosta-\\nglandin-related substances; bossibly through receptora. Further-\\nmore, endothelial cells have a great capacity for hydrolyzing\\nkinins to inactive products. Hence even invoking active transport,\\nless than 12 of kining might be expected to reach the first layer\\nof smooth muscle cells. However, kinina may not act directly on\\nsmooth muscle as endothelial cella and smooth muscle cells form\\nspecialized cell contacts.

To define further the composition of IL-2\\nreceptors, both IL-2 itself and anti-Tac were used as ligands to adsorb membrane proteins for analysis by\\nHodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Na DodSO/PAGE). A variety of experimental\\napproaches yield results indicating that the Tac antigen, which migrates as a single protein on No Dod-\\nSO/PAGE under reducing conditions, is also expressed as disulfide-linked bomodimers and oligomers.\\nExamined under nonreducing conditions, both activated normal human T cells and cell lines from patients\\nwith adult T cell leukemia (HUT-102; MT-1) express Tac antigen homodimers (M, 105 000) in addition\\nto monomers (4, 54000). Formation of the disulfide bond is not a consequence of the experimental\\nprocedures used to isolate the proteins for analysis, inasmuch as ideatical results are obtained when the\\nreceptor proteins are iodinated and extracted in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide or prepared for clec-\\ntrophoresis in the absence of heat denaturation. Accordingly, these findings point to Tae antigen associating\\nwith itself preferentially. The physiologic significance of homodimer and oligomer formation, especially\\nas it relates to the formation of bigb-affinity IL-2 receptors, is presently unknown.\\nUntil now the structure of the interleukin 2 (12-2) receptor\\n(Robb et al., 1981) ban cluded complete description despite\\nconsiderable effort utilizing both blochemical and gentic ap\\nproaches.
